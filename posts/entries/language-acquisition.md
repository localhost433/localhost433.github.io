Recently, I learnt about the language acquisition process. There was the big question of:

Do we have our thoughts organized/emerged in languages or not?

Through tragic example this could be a subject of study, but the barrier here is that if a person who have missed their entire critical period, therefore unable to acquire any language. They are unable to express themselves as an individual, that there is a lack of output, because even if the person understands the input, it is unable to output in that way.

To put in a personal response from myself to the problem,

When I was in primary school, a weekend morning when I just woke up, I heard two voices in a wierd tone that I couldn't understand. But I then realized it was my parents talking about something in mandarin, before realizing it I didn't recognize the language they were speaking, and that was super interesting.
  
Because I come to that 'aha' moment through thinking the sentence: "What are they talking about?(他们在说什么？)" (In Mandarin Chinese, which is the only language I spoke at the moment) in my head. Then I just found the string of sounds they are speaking becomes familiar and interpretable. So yes, I think my answer to the problem is that people, at least people who have learned to speak one language, think in terms of language; that might not be a conclusive answer to the question, it is the best one I can get.
