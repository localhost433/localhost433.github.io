This is (going to be) the first post, the first thing I'm writing in Markdown. I thought about doing the whole thing in $\LaTeX$, but it would be weird, so yeah... I came to this idea of a blog website only after going down a rabbit hole on Reddit, and I start wondering "it would actually be cool if I have some type of project that I work on", so here I am. I felt like I'm only going to learn the practical stuff that I'm actually going to use while doing "side quests" like this that I'm interested in.

(One random thought, no matter what I write, it appears more formal than I would do while I'm talking.)

I'm just going to write some linear alg stuff here since I left my notebook in Canada while coming back from the spring break. Anyways, I have to complete orthogonal projection, least squares, adjoint operators, and orthogonal transformations before next lecture tomorrow. This is not going well.

For some unknown reason I added the author section; also I have no idea what to put for tags. Anyways, that's it.
$\qed{}$ (After typing this \qed{} I realized it became some type of ritual I was unaware of.)
