I found out that, $6! 7! = 10!$, and $3! 5! = 6!$. Then I was wondering if there are any other solutions to these types of equations, turned out that for the trivial family $(n!)! = (n! - 1)! \cdot n!$, there are infinitely many. But for non-trivial ones, this appears to be an open problem, known as Surányi's conjecture. The only known solution is the case $(6, 7, 10)$. This conjecture was proposed by Surányi (with Erdős), Hickerson proposed a more generalized version.

I was trying to look for more information, but it seems like the topic is too deep into number theory that I can't understand much of it...
