## The rationale
It's such a wierd idea to compare a natural language to programming langueges, since I have put some thought into this, I'd better write it out.

## Learning
The Chinese language is known for it's difficulty to learn; personally, I don't think this is true, every language have the same difficulty to learn, as they are created equally complex with the equal intellectuals of the human mind. However, a number of factors may influence one's perception on that. To English speakers, Chinese might be the most distinct language to encounter compared to English.

## Command Set
There are 26 alphabets in English, and a couple thousand (at least the common ones) characters in Chinese. But for a person to read/understand a piece of text, it takes longer for a person who's mother tongue is English. This is because a lot of new words in Chinese are created with the combination of existing characters, thus a child could easily categorize the word.

To illustrate this, consider a child who have seen the word 'Cashmere' for the first time, without context, it would be difficult to associate it with goat or wool. In Chinese, the word translates into '羊绒' (Literally: Sheep-velvet/fleece); Another example, 'computer' in Chinese is '电脑' (electric-brain). Words in English might make sense in terms of etymology if one gets into memorizing the roots and affixes, but before that not so much. So, after learning the basic characters, one can create/guess new words and sentences in Chinese.

## Class & Inheritance
That sounds similar to '*class*' & '*inheritance*', and applying to the characters as well. By the way characters are created and attached as affixes, one could then make it inherit certain property from the parent class. More character '*packages*' is needed only if getting into a specialized area, like chemistry or biology etc. But in English there is always something that you don't know pops up.

## Syntax
The syntax rules of Chinese is a bit complex, in terms of there is always exceptions coming. It doesn't even have to follow SVO sometimes.

## Entropy
People have also observed that the information density of Chinese is greater than many languages. In my opinion, this is probably due to that people were trying to save space/material when characters were created to write on bamboo and wooden slips.

### Polymorphisms
There could be other factors contributing to this as well, for example, there is a lot of *polymorphisms* in the Chinese language; By that I mean a character have several meanings on it's own, not just class-changing usage, but found in different scenarios.

## TBC
This is all I have in my mind now, anyways I'll continue to write about it if there's more.
