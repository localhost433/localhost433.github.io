I went to smalls today, it's the second club I went to, with the first one being the blue note (which was more commercial in a way I guess?).

The quartet playing was fantastic, I guess that's a thing about live music that its different, you get to feel the vibe(such an abstract word).
> I'll elaborate on that a little bit, I think its because you can see the musicians, their facial expressions, their interactions with each other and that with the audience.
> You can feel the energy and the mood of the room, that at a certain point it becomes a collective feeling making you applause. 
> There was a time I felt bad for the drummer, because he was playing a solo and no one clapped after he finished, so that's a moment where you can feel the mood isn't there yet, at least at this part of the song.

There are two type of people you see in a jazz club, since there's not much people talking (covered by the music even if you tried to), distinguish them by their gestures:
1. The ones who are really, really into the music (those moving their head and tapping their feet, or those who stick their eyes to the stage)
2. The ones who are forced to be there... because their friends dragged them there (ones looking at their phones, or falling asleep)

This covers 95% of the people, the rest are the ones that will walk out after a few songs.

The jam sessions were great too, I was surprised that so many musicians were sitting beside us in the audience, maybe they want to support their friends? Two of them certainly did know each other as they were sitting beside us.

- It is subtly funny in a way that you see the trumpeter, saxophonist and bassist taking turns to play waiting for their turn. (Doesn't have an image, for anyone reading please imagine)

Earlier in the day when I took the 6 to come downtown from Grand Central, on these stairs of Astor place exit; two people spoke polish/russian (sounded like a eastern european language to me) passed by, then I heard one guy in front of me saying "Speak American!" to another guy with him (crazy btw). Idk, a image of a WWI (or WWII, I can't remember exactly) poster about like 'SPEAK AMERICAN! Don't speaking the enemy's language'(german? or something) came to my mind rightaway.
