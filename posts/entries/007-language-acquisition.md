Recently, I learned about the language acquisition process. There was the big question of:

Do we have our thoughts organized/emerged in languages or not?

Through tragic examples this could be a subject of study, but the barrier here is that if a person has missed their entire critical period and is therefore unable to acquire any language, they are unable to express themselves as an individual. There is a lack of output because, even if the person understands the input, they are unable to produce output in that way.

To offer a personal response to the problem,

When I was in primary school, one weekend morning when I had just woken up, I heard two voices in a weird tone that I couldn't understand. I then realized it was my parents talking about something in Mandarin. Before realizing it, I didn't recognize the language they were speaking, and that was super interesting.
  
Because I came to that 'aha' moment by thinking the sentence: "What are they talking about? (他们在说什么？)" (in Mandarin Chinese, which was the only language I spoke at the time) in my head. Then I found the string of sounds they were speaking became familiar and interpretable. So yes, I think my answer to the problem is that people—at least people who have learned to speak one language—think in terms of language; that might not be a conclusive answer to the question, but it's the best one I can give.
