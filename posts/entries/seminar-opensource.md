I went to a seminar where the speaker was discussing about the purpose/development, and many stuff about opensource that I didn't know before.

## Three challenges of Opensource
Three things that couldn't make him go to sleep at night (in opensource, of course):
1. **Over-differentiation**
   Projects focusing on differentiation from each other instead of adding more functionality.
2. **Proliferation**
   Sheer number. Maybe leading to a duplicated effort working on the same thing.
3. **Fragmentation**
   Espeacially with internal/public, upstream/downstream branches in terms of workforce. Internal forks diverge too much from the public version.

## The Purpose of Opensource
It's pretty surprising to hear that it isn't a "aloha" thing, but think deeper down it makes a lot of sense; there could be altruism, but corporations must have some practical reasons behind adopting this. For three levels:

- **Corporations**: Share the burden of development, attract talent, and build ecosystems around their products.
- **Individuals**: Learning, networking, showcasing skills.
- **Society**: Fosters innovation. (decentralize/democratizes technology as they say).

## Opensource in Public Service
Governments and organizations are adopting open source mainly for cost-effectiveness. Also there's a UN Open Source Week(???), which takes place in June (includes a hackathon), I might look into that later but it sounds interesting.

## How Projects Evolve
How projects start with a specific purpose but evolves into something much larger through this process:

- **Community Building**
- **Corporate Involvement**
  Companies utilize open source for practical reasons, such as reducing development costs, accelerating innovation, and avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Balancing Purpose and Practicality**
  A balance between serving the public good and addressing practical needs.
