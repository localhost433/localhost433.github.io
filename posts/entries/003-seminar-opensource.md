I went to a seminar where the speaker was discussing the purpose and development of open source, and many things about open source that I didn't know before.

## Three challenges of Open Source
Three things that kept him from sleeping at night (in open source, of course):
1. **Over-differentiation**
   Projects focusing on differentiating from each other instead of adding more functionality.
2. **Proliferation**
   Sheer number. This may lead to duplicated effort working on the same thing.
3. **Fragmentation**
   Especially with internal/public and upstream/downstream branches in terms of workforce. Internal forks diverge too much from the public version.

## The Purpose of Open Source
It's pretty surprising to hear that it isn't an "aloha" thing, but thinking more deeply it makes a lot of sense; there could be altruism, but corporations must have some practical reasons behind adopting this. At three levels:

- **Corporations**: Share the burden of development, attract talent, and build ecosystems around their products.
- **Individuals**: Learning, networking, showcasing skills.
- **Society**: Fosters innovation (decentralizes/democratizes technology, as they say).

## Open Source in Public Service
Governments and organizations are adopting open source mainly for cost-effectiveness. Also there's a UN Open Source Week (???), which takes place in June (includes a hackathon). I might look into that later; it sounds interesting.

## How Projects Evolve
How projects start with a specific purpose but evolve into something much larger through this process:

- **Community Building**
- **Corporate Involvement**
   Companies utilize open source for practical reasons, such as reducing development costs, accelerating innovation, and avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Balancing Purpose and Practicality**
   Finding a balance between serving the public good and addressing practical needs.
