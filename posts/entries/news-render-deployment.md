## Datathon and Technicals
After I got the news from a friend, I felt it was an unbelievable thing to hear. It really did surprise me that we stood out among all the teams that participated. When I joined the team, I was hoping we could gain a more experienced member, but everyone I asked had other stuff to do, so we headed straight there that Friday.

On the technical side, there were many more features I wanted to implement, and I didn't successfully deploy it on Render at that time. The static page worked well, but as I was running out of time, I just wrote instructions to let people deploy it locally so I could head over to the jazz club on time.

Speaking from a few weeks later, debugging it for the Render deployment is still painful; it spends 20 minutes every time just to build and get it running live. (These little üéâ emojis in the service log are one of the only reasons I keep doing this.)

Sometimes:
- It couldn't even make it there.

Other times:
- It ran out of memory (free tier...).
- It returned a 404 for a file that was supposed to be there.

Eventually, I downgraded so much by sacrificing many features, to make it use less memory/storage in general, and perhaps rebuilding the index every time I deployed it again,
still,
502.

I just have to keep trying. The thing is, once I change something and it doesn't work, I try to find the problem. But when this happens too many times, I fear I'll never get it to work, and I might just roll back to the previous version. Finally, making it run (and then dealing with the next problem) gives me some satisfaction overall.

## Inconfidence
People say it doesn't matter if you have the skill, but what if I don't? I seem to have the skill, or do I? There is some kind of inconfidence deep inside me. Frankly, I'm jealous of other people who do not fear (at least it seems like it), who do not appear to fall into this trap.

The good news from winning the Datathon is some positive feedback that I really need right now, because I don't have a good GPA and don't feel competent enough. I applied to a frontend job on Handshake, it's on-campus as well, but I hesitated even before I applied. The status stayed as ‚ÄúReviewed‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúDeclined‚Äù or anything else. I guess that's it (maybe I couldn't stay on site for the whole summer; that's the problem).

## Harsh Inner Critic
I tend to be either too harsh or too indulgent. If anything starts going wrong, everything else seems to follow like dominoes; and if things are going right, I'd better keep that streak running or I'll fall into a phase of lying in bed all day. This is (or was) a bad mindset to have.

Whether at one end or the other of the spectrum, no exceptions. I'll see if I can come up with a solution anytime soon. Problems dealing with oneself can only be solved by oneself; others may aid along the way but can't do the work for you.
