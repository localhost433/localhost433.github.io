## What's the idea?
Predict the NYC mayoral election outcome.

## Where did I get the idea from
In April, I read a news article discussing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01553). The method of trying to predict the papal election was interesting. After getting bombarded with advertisements about the NYC mayoral elections, I was instantly reminded of this, and here I am with this idea.

The good point about this idea is that, unlike the papal election, there's plenty of polls and data out there online. And all the candidates (fewer than 20) are known. However, there's a primary coming in a few weeks, and another election in November.

## What we did
It's really a lot of work to do in ~2 weeks with classes, but we finished the main functions of the model. Although the predictions aren't very promising at the moment, they're reasonable to some point. Personally, I'd like Mamdani to win this primary, and indeed he did winâ€”aligning with the output of what I predicted.
