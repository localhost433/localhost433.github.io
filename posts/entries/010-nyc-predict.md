## What's the idea?
Predict the NYC mayoral election outcome.

## Where did I get the idea from
In April, I read a news article speaking about [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01553), the method of trying to predict the pope election was interesting. After getting bombarded with advertisement about the NYC mayoral elections, I instantly got reminded about this, therefore here I am with this idea.

The good point about this idea is that, this election is unlike the pope election, and there's plenty of polls, data out there online. And all the candidates (less than 20) have been known. However, there's a primary coming in a few weeks, and another one in November.

## What we did
It's really a lot of work to do in ~2 week with classes, but we finished with the main functions of hte model. Although the predictions aren't very promising at the moment, it's reasonable to some point. Personally I'd like Mamdani to win this primary, and indeed he did win. Aligning with the output of what I have predicted.
