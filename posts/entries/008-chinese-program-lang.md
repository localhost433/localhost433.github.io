## The rationale
It's such a weird idea to compare a natural language to programming languages; since I've put some thought into this, I'd better write it out.

## Learning
The Chinese language is known for its difficulty to learn; personally, I don't think this is true. Every language has the same difficulty to learn, as they are equally complex products of the human mind. However, a number of factors may influence one's perception of that. To English speakers, Chinese might be the most distinct language to encounter compared to English.

## Command Set
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and a couple thousand (at least the common ones) characters in Chinese. But for a person to read/understand a piece of text, it can take longer for someone whose mother tongue is English. This is because a lot of new words in Chinese are created by combining existing characters; thus a child can more easily categorize the word.

To illustrate this, consider a child who sees the word 'cashmere' for the first time; without context, it would be difficult to associate it with goats or wool. In Chinese, the word translates to '羊绒' (literally: sheep-velvet/fleece). Another example: 'computer' in Chinese is '电脑' (electric-brain). Words in English might make sense in terms of etymology if one memorizes roots and affixes, but before that, not so much. So, after learning the basic characters, one can create/guess new words and sentences in Chinese.

## Class & Inheritance
That sounds similar to '*class*' and '*inheritance*', and it applies to characters as well. By the way characters are created and attached as affixes, one could then make them inherit certain properties from the parent class. More character '*packages*' are needed only when getting into a specialized area, like chemistry or biology, etc. But in English there is always something you don't know popping up.

## Syntax
The syntax rules of Chinese are a bit complex, in that there are always exceptions. It doesn't even have to follow SVO sometimes.

## Entropy
People have also observed that the information density of Chinese is greater than many languages. In my opinion, this is probably because people were trying to save space/material when characters were created to write on bamboo and wooden slips.

### Polymorphisms
There could be other factors contributing to this as well. For example, there are a lot of *polymorphisms* in the Chinese language; by that I mean a character can have several meanings on its own, not just class-changing usage, but found in different scenarios.

## TBC
This is all I have in my mind now; anyway, I'll continue to write about it if there's more.
