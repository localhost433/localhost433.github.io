This is the first post—a small hello to the project that got me out of a Reddit rabbit hole and into building something I’ll actually use. I almost wrote the whole thing in $\LaTeX$, but then I remembered I’m trying to make a blog, not a math textbook.

Writing here feels slightly more formal than talking. It nudges me to say things clearly, even when I’m just thinking out loud.

Anyways, I have to complete orthogonal projection, least squares, adjoints, and orthogonal transformations before lecture tomorrow. (Because I left my notebook in Canada and deadlines remain undefeated.) It’s not going well.

What I want from this site:

- A place to put ideas before I forget them.
- A reason to make small things often.
- A record of what I learned.

If nothing else, this is a start. $\qed{}$ (After typing this \qed{} I realized it has become some type of ritual I was unaware of.)
