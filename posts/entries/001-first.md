This is (going to be) the first post, the first thing I'm writing in Markdown. I thought about doing the whole thing in $\LaTeX$, but it would be weird, so yeah... I came to this idea of a blog website only after going down a rabbit hole on Reddit, and I started wondering "it would actually be cool if I had some type of project to work on", so here I am. I feel like I only really learn the practical stuff I'm actually going to use by doing "side quests" like this that I'm interested in.

(One random thought, no matter what I write, it appears more formal than I am when I'm talking.)

I'm just going to write some linear algebra stuff here since I left my notebook in Canada while coming back from spring break. Anyway, I have to complete orthogonal projection, least squares, adjoint operators, and orthogonal transformations before next lecture tomorrow. This is not going well.

For some unknown reason I added the author section, and I have no idea what to put for tags. Anyway, that's it.
$\qed{}$ (After typing this \qed{} I realized it has become some type of ritual I was unaware of.)
