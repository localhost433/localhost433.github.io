# Syntax

## Defining Syntax

"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." - Chomsky, 1957

### Knowledge of sentence structure

1. Difference between **grammatical** and **meaningful**.
2. Cannot determine **grammaticality** by comparing new sentences and phrases to those we have seen before.

Some knowledge of rules that allow us to construct new sentences.
**Syntax** is the study of those rules.

### What do syntaticians study?
- How we combine words to form sentences
- In other words, the **tacit knowledge** we have about how language is structured.

### Learning vs. Acquisition
Children don't learn to speak languages the way they learn to tie their shoes or set the table.
- Conscious Knowledge is learned
- Unconscious knowledge is acquired.

Children must acquire certain individual properties of the language they are exposed to.

### Noam Chomsky and Universal Grammar
- Language is an **instinct**.
- While individual languages must be acquired, much of language is **innate**.
- **Universal Grammar** (UG)

### Type of data Syntaticians use
- Major source of data: **Grammaticality judgements**. Psychological experiment performed with a native speaker of the language you are studying.
- Symbols
  
|  Meaning                           |    Symbol    |
| :--------------------------------: | :----------: |
| Ungrammatical                      |       *      |
| Variablity                         |       %      |
| Grammatical, nonsense semantically |       #      |

### Generative grammar
- sentences generated by rules

### Hypothesis
- Competence vs. Performance
  - Focused on Competence in syntax.


## From words to word classes
### Grammatical categories
Aim to make generalization about how words combine to form sentences.

### Identifying grammatical categories
- Morphological tests
  - by affixes only attach to certain word classes
  - if passes, it must be a member of that category, but not vice versa.
- Distributional evidence
  - By looking at the distributional evidence, we can therefore say something about the grammatical category.

### Two main groups
- **Lexical** categories denote concepts like objects, attributes, actions, and ideas
- **Functional** categories specify grammatical relations

## From words to phrases
Hypothesis:
1. A sentence is a collection of objects.
2. A sentence is an *ordered* collection of words.

### Constituents
- Some word form units (constituents), while others not.

#### Tests to identify constituents
- Fragment/Stand alone test
  - Constituents can stand on their own in response to a question.
- Replacement/substitution test
  - Some constituents can be replaced by other words, without radically changing the meaning.
- Movement test
  - Some constituents can move as units.
- Clefting/psuedo-clefting
  - Clefting: *It was ... that ...*
  - Psuedo-Clefting: *... is/are (what/where/who) ...*
- Coordination
  - Two constituents of the same type can be coordinated using conjunction words like *and*, *or* and *but*.
