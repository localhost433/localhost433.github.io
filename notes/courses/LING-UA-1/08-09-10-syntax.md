# Syntax

## Defining Syntax

"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." - Chomsky, 1957

### Knowledge of sentence structure

1. Difference between **grammatical** and **meaningful**.
2. Cannot determine **grammaticality** by comparing new sentences and phrases to those we have seen before.

Some knowledge of rules that allow us to construct new sentences.
**Syntax** is the study of those rules.

### What do syntaticians study?
- How we combine words to form sentences
- In other words, the **tacit knowledge** we have about how language is structured.

### Learning vs. Acquisition
Children don't learn to speak languages the way they learn to tie their shoes or set the table.
- Conscious Knowledge is learned
- Unconscious knowledge is acquired.

Children must acquire certain individual properties of the language they are exposed to.

### Noam Chomsky and Universal Grammar
- Language is an **instinct**.
- While individual languages must be acquired, much of language is **innate**.
- **Universal Grammar** (UG)

### Type of data Syntaticians use
- Major source of data: **Grammaticality judgements**. Psychological experiment performed with a native speaker of the language you are studying.
- Symbols
  
|  Meaning                           |    Symbol    |
| :--------------------------------: | :----------: |
| Ungrammatical                      |       *      |
| Variablity                         |       %      |
| Grammatical, nonsense semantically |       #      |

### Generative grammar
- sentences generated by rules

### Hypothesis
- Competence vs. Performance
  - Focused on Competence in syntax.


## From words to word classes
### Grammatical categories
Aim to make generalization about how words combine to form sentences.

### Identifying grammatical categories
- Morphological tests
  - by affixes only attach to certain word classes
  - if passes, it must be a member of that category, but not vice versa.
- Distributional evidence
  - By looking at the distributional evidence, we can therefore say something about the grammatical category.

### Two main groups
- **Lexical** categories denote concepts like objects, attributes, actions, and ideas
- **Functional** categories specify grammatical relations

## From words to phrases
Hypothesis:
1. A sentence is a collection of objects.
2. A sentence is an *ordered* collection of words.
3. **A sentence is a hierarchical structure where words are organized into hierarchical units/constituents.**

### Constituents
- Some word form units (constituents), while others not.

#### Tests to identify constituents
1. Fragment/Stand alone test
   - Constituents can stand on their own in response to a question.
2. Replacement/substitution test
   - Some constituents can be replaced by other words, without radically changing the meaning.
3. Movement test
   - Some constituents can move as units.
4. Clefting/psuedo-clefting
   - Clefting: *It was ... that ...*
   - Psuedo-Clefting: *... is/are (what/where/who) ...*
5. Coordination
   - Two constituents of the same type can be coordinated using conjunction words like *and*, *or* and *but*.

### Tree diagrams
- A tree diagram is a hierarchical structure consisting of **nodes** and **branches**.
- A undirected, unweighted acyclic graph, binary with two exceptions could be ternary.
- Terminologies:
  - Root node: [Same in CS]
  - Terminal node: leaf nodes
  - Sibling, parents, children: [Same in CS]

#### Determine types of phrases
- While determining the identity of a node (type of phrase), think back to the distributional tests from earlier.

## From phrases to sentences

### Phrase structure rules
One way to think about the structure of sentences is captured by phrase structure rules. These are generative rules that tell us how to form grammatical structures.

#### VP -> (AdvP) V (NP) (PP) (AdvP)
- VP: Verb phrases
- AdvP: Adverb phrases
- NP: Noun phrases
- PP: Prepositional phrases

#### NP -> (D) (AdjP) N (PP)
- AdjP: Adjective phrases
- D: Determiners

#### AdjP -> (AdvP) Adj
- Adjective phrases must contain an adjective, possibly modified by an additional adverb.

#### AdvP -> (AdvP) AdV
- Similarly, adverbial phrases must contain an adverb, possibly modified by an additional adverb.

#### PP -> P NP

### Combine it all into a Sentence
S -> NP VP
- S: Sentence
Additionally, it could be that VP -> V S, which lead to recursion.

### Extending Sentences
#### Recursion
- Given S -> NP VP and VP -> V S, we can now make infinitely long sentences, thus being **recursive**.
- **Embedding** sentences within one another is one instance of recursion.

#### Coordination
Coordinating constituents for the same syntactics

### X-bar theory
X-bar theory provides a uniform structural view for the seemingly abstract phrase structure rules, Every phrase in every sentence in every language is organized the same way.
- Every phrase has a **head**, and it may optionally have a **specifier** and/or a **complement**.
- A node is said to **dominate** all nodes below it and **immediately dominate** the node just below it.

```text
XP
├── X'
│   ├── (Complement)
│   └── X (Head)
└── (Specifier)
```

A example sentence as a TP.
```text
TP
├── T'
│   ├── VP
│   │   └── V'
│   │       ├── NP
│   │       │   ├── N'
│   │       │   │   └── N
│   │       │   └── D
│   │       └── V
│   └── [+/-past]/Aux.
└── NP
    └── N'
        └── N
```

#### Phrasal heads
- The head is the core part of the phrase and is the non-terminal node in a phrase
- The lexical category of the head correspond to the

#### Complements
A phrase that is the sibling to the head and a child to the bar-level.

#### Specifier
A phrase that is sibling to the bar level, child to the phrase.

#### Tense head of a sentence
A sentence is a tense phrase (TP), with a tense feature/auxillary verb.

```text
TP
├── T'
│   ├── VP
│   │   └── V'
│   └── T
└── NP
```

## Subcategories
Not all verbs are created equal:
- Optional NP
- throw (Obligatory NP, Optional PP complements)
- put (Obligatory NP and PP complements)
- Obligatory NP/PP

### C-selection aka. subcategorization
- Intransitive verbs
  - Take no complements
- Transitive
  - Take one NP complement
- Ditransitive
  Come in two forms (dative alternation):
  - Two NP complements
  - One NP compelement and one PP complement
- Verbs selection for a PP
  - May (obligatorily) take a PP complement, typically with a specific preposition
- Verbs selection for a clause
  - Taking a CP(:= a complementizer phrase), i.e., a phrase headed by a complementizer such as *that*, *if* and *whether*.
  - The complement of a CP is a TP, i.e., a tense clause.

### S-selection
Words may pose requirements to the semantic features of specifiers and complements.

## Adjuncts
Adjunts are, constituents that do not fulfill necessary functions in the sentence. (that could be emmited)

### Adjuncts and X-bar theory
A sibling to a bar-level and a child to another (higher) bar-level.

### Different types of adjunts
- Context of VPs
  - modifying the VP event, no the Noun itself.
- Context of NPs
  - Modifying the Noun.

### Distinguishing complements & adjuncts
- VPs: If a constituents is necessary for the verb to form a grammatical sentence, it is probably a complement; if not, adjunct
- PPs: Constituent following the preposition is always a complement.
- AdjPs: If adjective is followed by an *of*-phrase, it's a complement.
- NPs:
  - Noun followed by an *of*-phrase, complement
  - else, adjunct

Some java style psuedocode: 
```java
public String adjVsComp(Phrase phrase) {
  switch (phrase.getCategory()) {
    case VP:
      return phrase.isRequiredByHead() ? "complement" : "adjunct";
    case PP:
      return "complement";
    case AdjP:
      return phrase.hasFollowingOfPhrase() ? "complement" : "adjunct";
    case NP:
      return phrase.hasFollowingOfPhrase() ? "complement" : "adjunct";
    default:
      return "unknown";
  }
}
```
```

Potential structural ambiguity, example:
"We ate the food in the kitche."
1. We ate the food, the food was in the kitchen.
2. We ate the food, and we were in the kitchen.
