# Morphology

## Different types of words
Content words (open class words):
- Nouns
- Verbs
- Adjectives
- Adverbs

Function words (close class words):
- Conjunctions
- Prepositions
- Articles
- Pronoun

## What is morphology?
Study of morphemes, smallest meaningful units in language.

### Morpheme vs. Phoneme
Phonemes are contrastive units of sounds, do not carry any meaning on their own.

### Morpheme vs. Syllable
A syllable is a prosodic unit based on sounds, not meaning.

### Morpheme vs. Word
Both have meanings.
- A word is a freestanding unit of meaning
  - can be simple, made up of a single morpheme
  - can be complex, made up of more than one morpheme.
- Morphemes are meaningful units that can, but don't have to, stand on their own.

### Meaning of morphemes
- Meaning of morpheme must be constant.
- Some morphemes sharing the same form may have multiple meanings.

### Form of morphemes
Sometimes, morphemes come in different forms, which is referred to as **allomorphs**.
- Form of a morpheme may change based on phonotactic rules.
- Other times, the different forms are remnants of older varieties of the language.
  - Despite the different realization, they are considered the same morpheme because the meaning is constant.

## Type of morphemes
Not all morphemes are created equal.

### Language specific
What's bound in one language can be free in another.

In English, most bound morphemes are affixes. Affixes are classified by where they attached to a word
- **Prefixes** attach to the beginning of a word
- **Suffixes** attach to the end of a word
- **Infixes** go in the middle of a word
- **Circumfixes** go around the word (on both sides)

### Roots vs. Stems
- Morphologically complex words consist of a **root** and one or more affixes.
- Some roots can stand along as a word.
- Other roots cannot stand alone as a word (so-called bound roots)
- When a root morpheme is combined with an affixm it forms a **stem**. Other affixes can be added to a stem to form a more complex stem.

## Morphological Analysis
Perform morphological analysis to identify morphemes.
Identify **recurring forms** with **recurring meanings**.


## Word Building

### How languages build words
- **Non-concatenative** morphology build words by modifying a root. (Semitic languages)
- **Concatenative** morphology build words by attaching affixes to a root
  - **Agglutination** is when each affix attaches to a root seemingly one-by-one. (undrinkable)
  - **Fusion** is when affixes seem to fuse together before attaching to a root. (The man walks)

### Inflectional vs. Derivational morphemes
- **Derivational** morphemes create new words with a different meaning and may change the grammatical category.
  - A word may contain multiple derivational affixes.
  - *Class-changing*
  - *Class-maintaining*

- **Inflectional** morphemes convey grammatical information (e.g., tense, number, person) and never change the grammatical category of the stem. The number of inflectional morphemes in English is limited.
  - Inflectional morphemes can apply to almost all words of the appropriate category (they are *productive*). They are always applied *after* any derivational morphemes.
  - All inflectional morphemes are class maintaining.

### Multiple affix problem
- In English, affixes have rules about what word class they attach to and what word class they create.
- Sometimes affixes can be attached to more than one word class.
  - In these cases the meaning of the affixes are related
- When more than one affix is involved, there is a order of derivation.

### Building morphology trees
- Represent word internal structures as hierarchical trees
- Features:    
  - Binary-branching
  - Labelling each node with the grammatical category
  - **Each level must be a well-formed word**.

### Compounding
**Compounding** is the process of combining two already existing words into one.

### Zero Derivation
**Zero-Derivation** when a word changes word class, with no new morphemes added.

### Acronyms and initialisms
**Acronym**: Initials pronounced as a regular word.
**Initialism**: Initials pronounced as letters.

### Clipping and blending
**Clipping** refers to cutting off part of a word
**Blends** (portmanteaux) are created by putting clippings together.
