## Phonetics

Ineternation Phonetic Alphabet (IPA): Different sounds for same alphabets.
Write IPA in [square brackets] for phonetic transcription.

Different levels of specificity of transcription.

#### what is phonetics?
branch of linguistics that focuses on the inventory and structure of speech sounds

#### What do phoneticians study?
Articulatory Phonetics: How speech sounds are produces

### Speech production system
Move different part of mouth for different sounds.

#### How do we peoduce speech?
- The Vocal Tract

#### Consonants
Three key features:
- Voicing
  - Voiced: Vibrating (Vowels in English are voiced)
  - Voiceless: Held apart not vibrating
- Place of articulation
  - Bilabial
    - Oral: [$\textipa{p}$], [$\textipa{b}$], [$\textipa{w}$]
    - Nasal: [$\textipa{m}$]
      - m
  - Labiodental
    - [$\textipa{f}$], [$\textipa{v}$]
  - Interdental
    - [$\textipa{\theta}$], [$\textipa{\eth}$]
  - Alveolar
    - Oral: [$\textipa{t}$], [$\textipa{d}$], [$\textipa{s}$], [$\textipa{z}$], [$\textipa{l}$], [$\textipa{\*r}$]
    - Nasal: [$\textipa{n}$]
  - Post-Alveolar
    - [$\textipa{S}$], [$\textipa{tS}$], [$\textipa{N}$], [$\textipa{dN}$]
  - Palatal
    - [$\textipa{j}$]
  - Velar
    - Oral: [$\textipa{k}$], [$\textipa{g}$]
    - Nasal: [$\textipa{\engma}$]
  - Uvular
  - Glottal
    - h
    - 
- Manner of articulation
  - Airflow at the place of articulation
    - Completely obstructed (**consonants**)
    - Partially obstructed (**consonants**)
    - Relatively obstructed (**vowels**)
  - Stops
  - Fricatives
    - Partial obstruction of the airflow, causing turbulance
  - Affricates
    - A stop plus a fricative
  - Nasals
  - Liquids
    - Constriction but no turbulence
  - Glides
    - Semi-vowels, very vowel-like.

**Describe: Voicing, place, manner**

Natural Classes:
Obstruents:
- Stops
- Affricates
- Fricatives

Sonorants:
Rest.

Noncontinuants:
Obstruents + Nasal
Approximants:
rest.

Siblents.
