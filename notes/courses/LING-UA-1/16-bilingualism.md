# Bilingualism

---

## Terminology
- Bilinguilism & Multilingualism often used interchangeably.
- Native language vs. L1 (language learned from birth)
  - Languagelessness
  - L2, L3, etc.
- Second Language Acquisition (SLA) vs. Bilingual Language Acquisition (BLA)
- Target Language vs. Source language -> (language a learner is learning vs. the already known language)
- 'Mistakes/Errors' (Not really prescriptive in that terms)

---

## Defining Bilingualism
“We’ll say that bilingualism is **the ability to use two or more languages sufficiently to carry on a limited casual conversation**.”
(Myers-Scotton, p. 44)

But more complicated than that, criterias include:
- Level of required/sufficient **proficiency** in each language?
- Weigh proficiency equally across **skills**?
- Prodiciency across **domains of use**? (home, work, religious etc.)
- Context of acquisition? (age, setting, reason, etc.)

Maybe think "bilingual" as a broad category with bmany sub-categories.

---

## Typology of Bilingualism

---

### Proficiency level
- Balanced vs. Dominant bilinguals
- Additive vs. Subtractive bilinguals (how the process of acquiring the second language affect the acquisition of the first language)
- Receptive (passive) vs. Productive (active) bilinguals

---

### Age of acquisition
- Early vs. Late bilinguals
- Simultaneous vs. Successive (sequential) bilinguals

---

### Context of acquisition
- Compound vs. Coordinate bilinguals

---

## L2 Acquisition

---

### Perceiving and Discriminating sounds
Finding the word boundaries in a language you aren't familiar with is diffcult
This is because the L2 typically differes from the L1 in its
- phonemic inventory
- phonotactics

Different Phonotactics
- phonemes are language specific
- Allophones are also language specific

Different Syllable Structures

---

### Speaking like a 'Native'?
Many L2 learners will experience:
- A persistent asymmetry in comprehension and production
- Fossilization at some stage in the acquisition process before acquiring native-like proficiency

Factors contributing to the difficulty of L2 acquisition
- Neuroplasticity
  - Critical age hypothesis (7, 12, ...)
- Social factors
  - Adults are generally more self-conscious about their performance than kits

Positive factors as well:
- metalinguistic awareness 
- metacognitive skills, learning strategies
- motivation and attitude
- individual language attitude

---

## Language Transfer (interference)
L1 & L2 affecting each other.

- Negative transfer
  - Using L1 structures that don't exist in L2 when speaking L2
  - Inability to produce an L2 structure that doesn't exist in L1
- Positive transfer
  - Some form involve ways that an L1 helps a learner with an L2 in cases where the languages share some property
  - But some negative errors, in the forms of quantitative interference.

---

### Examples of Transfers
- Syntactic transfer
- Phonetic/ Phonemic Transfer

---

### Clues use to identify transfer errors
- Parallelism
  - Utterance contains a pattern that is ungrammatical in the target language but which can be found in the source language.
- Homogeneity
  - Learners who share a source language make the same error in the target language.
- Heterogeneity
  - Learners with different source languages make different errors in the target language.

---

## A Bilingual (Dis)advantage?
**Normative Monolingual Ideology**

---

### Why has monolingualism enjoyed a privileged status?
- Research on language acquisition has traditionally focused on monolingual children
  - Why?
    - US (western European) bias
    - Chomsky, the ideal speaker-listener
- However, it is just as common for children to grow up with more than one language in their environment, given one or more of the following scenarios
  - Language spokenar home


---

### Is growing up bilingual harmful for children?
Both quantity of input and quality of input matter for acquisition
Monolingual children will have enough input to construct a mental grammar sonner than bilingual children will

Any delays even out relatively early
- Bilinguals equal or exceed monolinguals in terms of terminologies

---

### Advantages?
- Executive function: the set of mental processes that govern our attention and control our behavior.
- Correlated with higher cognitive flexibility?
- Contribute to cognitive reserve?

---

### Policies around Bilingualism
**Policy and science don't always align**

Proponents for English-only policy in the US.
Educational Language Policies around the world: Haiti
Singaporean 

---

## Societal Bilingualism
Typical factors:
- Political events
- Economic reasons
- Cultural and religious reasons
- Individual motivations
  - Instrumental motivation
  - Identity-based motivation

---

### Diglossia
A situation in which two languages are used in a community, often by the same speakers, but are generally confined to different domains of use.

---

### Languages in Context
**Pidgins & Creoles**


Rule-governed with simplified grammatical system and lexicons
Superstrate language, infra

Pidgins has no native speakers, stabilized, Becomes creole.
