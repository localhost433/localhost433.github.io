# Acquisition

## Big questions in language acquisition
- How do children acquire language?
  - How much of language is learned?
  - How much of language is innate?
  - What is the role of the environment?

## Stages in Language acquisition

### An ordered enterprise
- Some aspects of language develop early while others are acquired much later:
  - Surprisingly, the order of how things are acquired is constant across individuals and between languages, even across modalities.
  - Although a child’s grammar develops over time, it is always rule-governed; any "errors" reflect a systematic grammar that simply is not yet adult-like.
  - Children always understand more than what they produce.

### How to study language acquisition
- Corpus studies (child)
  - Interested in the error the children make
- Controlled experiments (infants and toddlers)
  - Passifier sucking-paradigm
  - Head turn preference-paradigm
  - Preferential looking-paradigm
  - Elicitation-paradigm (wug)

### Stage 1
- Segmentation problem: Segment a steady stream of speech into unique sounds
- Invariance problem: Identify phonemes of their language despite hearing variation (allophonic and interspeaker).

#### Infant learning
Before the age of 6 months, babies are able to discriminate between any two sounds, regardless of whether it's used in their target language or not.
- Example: Infant before 6 month in a Japanese speaking environment are able to differentiate 'la' and 'ra'. (using this as example because /l/ and /r/ are allophones of /r/ in Japanese)
- Because the infant doesn't know what language they are going to speak.
Around the age of 6 months, they begin to lose the ability to discriminate between sounds that are not phonemic in their own language.

Babies are statistical trakers, be able to attune to statistical properties of the language in a few minutes  
Using such information, infants begin to segment speech.

#### Language production
- Crying
- Cooing: Soft, elongated vowel-like sounds
- Babbling: with 12 most common consonants.

When the baby is approximately 10 months old, babies only babble with sounds in their target language. 

### Stage 2
First words for naming around 9 months. Haven't yet learned to produce all the phonemes found in their targer language

#### One word stage
The order of acquiring sounds:
- Vowels
- Consonants based on the manner of articulation: Nasals -> Glides -> Stops -> Liquids -> Fricatives -> Affricates
- Consonants based on the place of articulation: Labials -> Velars -> Alveolars -> Palatals

Alternatives for phonemes not acquired yet (still rule governed)
- Substitution
- Omission
- Reduplication

#### Meaning
Start to use (near)words to convey an idea or action, the **holophrastic phase**.
- Form-meaning mapping

Children **overextend** and **underextend** the meaning of words (how to form catogories). Two principles for forming categories:
- **Form over color principle**
- **Whole object principle**

### Stage 3

#### Two word stage
About 1.5 years, children start putting together two words.  
Around 2 years old, children start producing two word sentences.
- Pitch is used to indicate that words group together
- No pauses

### Stage 4

#### Longer Sentences
The telegraphic stage, named after the short messages alluding to telegraph.

#### Morphology
Acquire different function words and inflectional morphemes.  
Combination of semantic complexity and formal complexity. So different languages have different orders for the acquisition of such grammatical words.

Acquisition of morphological rules is rule governed, described as a U-shaped development.
- First learn and store words individually
- Acquire morphological rules, and apply them everywhere by overgeneralization
- Correct and learned exceptions.

#### Syntax
- Start to use the passive by the age of 2, mater around the time around 3.
- Produce questions -> Use auxillaries
- Unpack relative clauses into the two component clauses around 4.

### Acquisition of signed languages
- In the same way the hearing babies acquire language.
- When deaf babies are not exposed to sign language, they will sometimes create their own signs, called **home sign**, complete with systematic rules.
- Nicaraguan Sign Language is an example of a recent language created by home signers coming together. (Demonstrated the human drive for communication.)

## Mechanisms behind language acquisition

### Nature vs. Nurture

#### Nature
The **innateness hypothesis**, also known as **nativism**, claims that nature deives language acquisition. (**Universal Grammar**)
- Structure-sensitivity: Children never make some mistakes.
- Over-generalization: Make generalization about the rule system  
Universal Grammar: certain things are given (**principles**) while other things (**parameters**) vary in a systematic way.

#### Nurture
The **general learning hypothesis** claims that language acquisition derives from
- interactions with others and general cognition
- The environment a child is raised
- Learning aspect of performing speech.

### The poverty of the stimulus
- Input isn't always informative enough for learners to figure out all the aspects of the language.
- Absence of negative evidence.

### What cannot explain language acquisition
- Child don't learn through **Imitation**
- Not through **Reinforcement**
  - Positive: Encourage when they say something correct
  - Negative: Correcting errors
- Not only acquire language when it is delivered in a specific way (Motherese/ CDS(Child Directed Speech)).

### Critical period
- The older you are, the more difficult acquire a language will be.
- First language acquisition must occur between birth and puberty, **the critical period**.
