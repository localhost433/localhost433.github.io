# Phonology
## Phones, Phonemes, Allophones

Phones: basic unit of speech sound, concrete, what we hear.

Two languages may use the same tone, but used differently.
- Difference between the **underlying sound** and how it is **phonetically realized**.

Checking for minimal pairs
- determining whether two phones are different.

Word pair where everything is identical except for a sound is called a minimal pair.

### Type of distribution

#### Contrastive distribution
There is a minimal pair

#### Complementary distribution
If there are no minimal pairs, it is not contrastive. That they are is a complementary distribution, meaning:
- they are used in different phonological contexts

#### Free Variation
can occur in the same context, but do not result in a contrast in meaning.

### Introducing the phoneme

Two sounds are in complementary distribution
They represent the same underlying sounds

i.e. smallest contrastive unit

#### Phonemes are not universal
Different ways to pronounce the phonemes are called allophones.
Phonemes and their allophones are language-specific.

one phone can be an allophone of more than one phoneme (Sounds like some type of polymorphism to me)

## Phonotactics
- How languages differ in their phonemic inventory.
- Differ how they use phonemes.

How phonemes can be sequenced.

### Syllables
- Prosodic unit in most languages.

```
syllable
|--rime
|  |--coda
|  |--nucleus                - Have to be there (usually vowels)
|--onset
```

#### Phonotactic constraints of English

### Sonority hierarchy
Sounds are ranked based on how 'loud' phones are.

### Tests
- Look for minimal pairs
  - Y: are phonemes
  - N: Allophones for the same phoneme
- Environments the words occur
  - In complementary or not

## Phonological Rules

### Example

#### Flapping rule
```
/t/ -> [r] | 'V_V
/t/ -> [t] | *elsewhere
```

#### Aspiration
```
/t/ -> [t^h] | _.'
/t/ -> [t] | elsewhere*
```

`/p/`, `/t/`, `/d/` follows this pattern with aspiration in English.

### Natural classes
Referring back to [the chart in 02](https://robinc.vercel.app).
Groupd of phones that can be defined by some phonetic similarity.

#### Feature specifications (based on the manner of articulation)
To determine the minimal distinguishing feature between two sounds.
- Continuants vs. Noncontinuants
- Obstruents vs. Sonorants
- Sibilants.
