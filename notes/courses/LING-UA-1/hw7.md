| 0:00 – 0:08 | **Will** | What’s this, a Taster’s-Choice moment between guys? This is really nice. You go**tt**a thing for swans? Is this like a fe**t**ish, is it something we need to devo**t**e some time to?                                                    |
| 0:08 – 0:30 | **Sean** | Thought about what you said to me the other day—about my pain**t**ing. Stayed up half the night thinking about it. Something occurred to me, and I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep, and I haven’t thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?                                                                         |
| 0:30 – 0:31 | **Will** | No.                                              |
| 0:31 – 0:42 | **Sean** | You’re just a kid. You don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about.                                                              |
| 0:42 – 0:43 | **Will** | Why, thank you.                                  |
| 0:43 – 0:46 | **Sean** | It’s all right. You’ve never been out of Boston. |
| 0:46 – 0:47 | **Will** | (after a beat) Nope.                             |
| 0:47 – 4:25 | **Sean** | <br> So if I asked you about art, you’d probably give me the skinny on every art book ever wri**tt**en—Michelangelo, you know a lot about him: life’s work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right? But I bet you can’t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel; you’ve never actually stood there and looked up at that beau**t**iful ceiling—seen that. </br> <br> If I ask you about women, you’d probably give me a syllabus of your personal favori**t**es; you may have even been laid a few times, but you can’t tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. </br> <br> If I ask you about war, you’d probably throw Shakespeare at me right—“Once more unto the breach, dear friends”—but you’ve never been near one; you’ve never held your best friend’s head in your lap and watched him gasp his last breath, looking to you for help. </br> <br> If I ask you about love you could quote me a sonnet, but you’ve never looked at a woman and been to**t**ally vulnerable—known someone who could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you, who could rescue you from the depths of Hell—and you wouldn’t know what it’s like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever through anything, through cancer. </br> <br> You wouldn’t know about sleeping while si**tt**ing up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term “visi**t**ing hours” don’t apply to you. You don’t know about real loss, because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself—and I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much. </br> <br> I look at you: I don’t see an intelligent, confident man; I see a cocky, scared-shitless kid. But you’re a genius, Will—no one denies that; no one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine and you ripped my fuckin’ life apart. You’re an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read *Oliver Twist*? Does that encapsula**t**e you? </br> <br> Personally, I don’t give a shit about all that, because you know what? I can’t learn anything from you that I can’t read in some fuckin’ book—unless you want to talk about you, who you are. Then I’m fascina**t**ed. I’m in. But you don’t want to do that, do you, sport? You’re terrified of what you might say. </br> <br> Your move, chief. </br> |
