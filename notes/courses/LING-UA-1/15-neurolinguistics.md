# Neurolinguistics

## What is Newrolinguistics?

### Human brain - crash course
- two hemispheres
  - each into four lobes
    - Frontal lobe (Executive functions such as attention, planning, decission making)
    - Temporal lobe (Language, auditory processing)
    - Parietal lobe (Spatial cognition, sensory information)
    - Occipital lobe (Vision)

The role of lobes may be similar across hemispheres, there are also hemispheric differences, called **lateralization.**
- Split-brain patients providesome evidence for this.

## Aphasia and the origin of neurolinguistics

### How to study language before neuroimaging
Study impaired language, as different types of **apahsias**. Aphasia arises from brain damage of some sort, common causes include:
- Stroke
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Neurodegenerative diseases
- Resective surgery (to treat epilepsy)

Rationale is known as the **deficit-lesion method**.
- Logic: If the individual cannot do X behavior, then the execution of X must depend on the lesioned area.
- Questions: Moral questions, conclusion

### Broca's aphasia
Paul Broca and the patient "Tan" (1861)
- Broca's area

Characteristics of Broca's aphasia:
- Slow, laborious, non-fluent speech with few if any grammatical morphemes.
- Comprehension relatively intact, but writing is limited.

### Fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia
Carl Wernicke's subsequent discovery (1874)

Characteristics of Fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia:
- Fluent but disordered speech and writing.
- Frequent substitutions of real words with nonsense words.
- impaired understanding of speech and writing.

### How much can we learn from aphasias
Get an idea of where and how language is organized in the brain by comparing behavior and lesson sites. Many disadvantages of relying on apasia studies:
- Inter-individual variability, no patients are identical, and difficult to replicable.
- Lot of reorganization can happen during recovery.
- Moral concerns.

## Modern neuroimaging techniques

### Overview of modern neuroimaging techniques
To investigate what the brain does, whare it does it, and when it does it.
- Structural imagining (measuring the structure of the brain)
- Functional imagining (measuring an aspect of brain function)
  - Non-invasive techniques (PET, fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.)
  - Invasive techniques (electrocorticography, single cell recordings)

### Hemodynamic techniques (PET & fMRI)
Measure blood, a dependent measure of neural activity
- PET: Positron Emission Tomography
- fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imagining

Increase in neuronal activity -> Increase in metabolic demand for glucose and oxygen -> Increase in cerebral blood flow to the activated region

Measures the work of the brain after it has happened.
Hemodynamic techniques have excellent spatial resolution but bad temporal resolution.

### Electrophysiological techniques (EEG & MEG)
Measure actual electrical activity of neurons
- EEG: Electroencephalography
- MEG: Magnetoencephalography

Neurons use electricity to communicate with each other -> Neuronal networks fire in synchrony -> the correlates of this combined electrical activity can be measured

Measures the work of the brain as it is happening
Electrophysiology conditions

## Some classic and modern findings

### Case studies
- Using modern neurolinguistics

#### Phonemes in the brain
Phillips et al. (2000): Does auditory cortex have access to phonemic categories? And when is phonemic category information accessed? 

Major Obstacle: To prove that any results are due to crossing a phoneme boundary rather than just differeces in the acoustics?

Approach:
Examine the **Auditory Mismatch Field** elicited in auditory cortex at ~180ms post stimulus onset by deviant stimuli in an **oddball paradigm**.

Conclusion: Auditory cortex has access to phonemes, not just acoustic features, and they are recognized quickly.

#### Semantics and syntax in the brain
Finding evidence for high-level processes? (higher than phonemes)

So called **violation studies** use EEG has investigated brain responses to when languages goes awry.

N400: Semantic anomalies. (negativity 400 ms after the stimulus onset)
P600: Syntactic anomalies. (positivity 600 ms after the stimulus onset)

Progression from smaller unit to larger unit in terms of time.

#### Putting two words together
Combining two lexical items involves at least three processes
- Syntactic composition
- Logico-semantic composition (properties combine to to form set of entities)
- Conceptual composition (features combine)

What aspects of composition is the brain sentitive to?

Bemis & Pylk√§anen(2011)

- two words vs. one word
  - Consonant string vs. psuedoword
- Task (picture matching)
- Composition  vs. List
  - To account for the visual presence of two words
  - Task varied for composition and list stimuli to avoid composition

Significant results, difference from two-word composition and one-word composition.

Reflect conceptual composition!
