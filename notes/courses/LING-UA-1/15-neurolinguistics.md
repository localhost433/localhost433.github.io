# Neurolinguistics

## What is Newrolinguistics?

---

### Intro
Uncovering the **neural bases of language**. Specifically, what parts of the brain are responsible for performing specific **linguistic computations** on **mental representations**?
- What the brain does?
- Where it does it?
- When it does it?

To identify a brain region that supports(correspond) to a type of linguistic process.

### Human brain - crash course
Parts:
- **Brain stem**
- **Cerebellum**
- **Cerebrum**
  - with outer part called the **cerebal cortex**
    - Consists $\approx 86$ Billion **neurons**
      - send and recieve signals from other neurons
      - realized as electric activity known as **action potentials**
    - **Grey matter**: Cell bodies and dendrites of neurons
    - **White matter**: Mylinated axons of neurons
    - Upper part of cortile wrinkles as **gyri** and lower part as **sulci**.
  - Supports higher level cognitive functions
  - two **hemispheres** connected by **corpus callosum**
    - each into four lobes
      - Frontal lobe (Executive functions such as attention, planning, decission making)
      - Temporal lobe (Language, auditory processing)
      - Parietal lobe (Spatial cognition, sensory information)
      - Occipital lobe (Vision)
    - Role of lobes may be similar across hemispheres, also hemispheric differences called **lateralization**.
      - **Split-brain patients** provide some evidence for this.

## Aphasia and the origin of neurolinguistics

---

### How to study language before neuroimaging?
Study impaired language, as different types of **apahsias**. Aphasia arises from brain damage of some sort, common causes include:
- Stroke
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Neurodegenerative diseases
- Resective surgery (to treat epilepsy)

Rationale is known as the **deficit-lesion method**.
- *Logic*: If the individual cannot do X behavior, then the execution of X must depend on the lesioned area.
- *Questions*:
  - Takes too long (have to wait patient die to perform autopsy)
  - Conclusion might not be correlated
  - Moral questions (Consent?)

### Broca's aphasia
Paul Broca and the patient "Tan" (1861)
- His conclusion: **Broca's area** responsible for language production.
- Found the patient actually have had more extensive damage later on. (so that might not be it?)

Characteristics of Broca's aphasia:
- Slow, laborious, non-fluent speech with few if any grammatical morphemes.
- Comprehension relatively intact, but writing is limited.

### Fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia
Carl Wernicke's subsequent discovery (1874)
- damage to left temporal and parietal areas as **Wernicke's area**
- no consensus about the exact location of this area, term isn't really used

Characteristics of Fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia:
- Fluent but disordered speech and writing.
- Frequent substitutions of real words with nonsense words.
- impaired understanding of speech and writing.

### How much can we learn from aphasias?
Get an idea of *where* and *how* language is organized in the brain by comparing behavior and lesion sites. Many disadvantages of relying on apasia studies:
- Inter-individual variability, no patients are identical, and very difficult to replicate.
- Lot of reorganization can happen during recovery.
- Moral concerns.

## Modern neuroimaging techniques

---

### Overview of modern neuroimaging techniques
To investigate *what* the brain does, *where* it does it, and *when* it does it.
- **Structural imagining** (measuring the structure of the brain)
- **Functional imagining** (measuring an aspect of brain function)
  - **Non-invasive techniques** (**PET** (to some extent), **fMRI**, **EEG**, **MEG** etc.)
  - **Invasive techniques** (electrocorticography, single cell recordings)

---

### Hemodynamic techniques (PET & fMRI)
Measure *blood*, a dependent measure of neural activity
- PET: Positron Emission Tomography
- fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imagining

Premise:

Increase in neuronal activity -> Increase in metabolic demand for glucose and oxygen -> Increase in cerebral blood flow to the activated region

*Measures the work of the brain after it has happened.*
Hemodynamic techniques have *excellent spatial resolution* but *bad temporal resolution*.

---

### Electrophysiological techniques (EEG & MEG)
Measure actual electrical activity of neurons
- EEG: Electroencephalography
- MEG: Magnetoencephalography

Neurons use electricity to communicate with each other -> Neuronal networks fire in synchrony -> the correlates of this combined electrical activity can be measured

*Measures the work of the brain as it is happening.*
Electrophysiology techniques have *~bad spatial resolution* but *excellent temporal resolution*.

## Some classic and modern findings (Case Studies)

---

### Phonemes in the brain
Phillips et al. (2000)

*Does auditory cortex have access to phonemic categories? And when is phonemic category information accessed?*

Obstacle:
- Prove that any results are due to crossing a *phoneme* boundary rather than just differeces in the *acoustics* properties.

Approach:
- Examine the **Auditory Mismatch Field** elicited in auditory cortex at ~180ms post stimulus onset by deviant stimuli in an **oddball paradigm**.

Conclusion:
- The brain (auditory cortex) has access to phonemes, not just acoustic features, and they are recognized quickly.

---

### Semantics and syntax in the brain
Finding evidence for high-level processes? (higher than phonemes)

So called **violation studies** use EEG has investigated brain responses to when languages goes awry.

- N400: Semantic anomalies. (negativity 400 ms after the stimulus onset)
- P600: Syntactic anomalies. (positivity 600 ms after the stimulus onset)

Progression from smaller unit to larger unit in terms of time.

Conclusion:
The brain gets surprised by semantically and syntactically anomalous stimuli.

---

### Putting two words together
Combining two lexical items involves at least three processes
- Syntactic composition
- Logico-semantic composition (properties combine to to form set of entities)
- Conceptual composition (features combine)

What aspects of composition is the brain sentitive to?

Bemis & Pylkkänen (2011)

Approach:
- 2 words vs. 1 word
  - Consonant string vs. psuedoword?
- Task (picture matching)
- Composition vs. List
  - To account for the visual presence of two words
  - Task varied for composition and list stimuli to avoid composition in list stimuli

Results: 
- difference from two-word composition and one-word composition.

Conclusion:
- The combination of minimal stimuli reflects **conceptual combination**-not syntactic nor semantic.
