# Psycholinguistics
Study the mental processes that underlie linguistic behavior and how these are organized. More interested in linguistic performance rather than competence, at all the linguistic levels.


## What is psycholinguistics?
- How do we perceive linguistic information?
- How do we produce linguistic information?

### Data in psucholinguistics
- Rely on behavioral data, typically in controlled experiments.
- There is a comprehension-production asymmetry as comprehension is easier to study in general.

### Psycholinguistic tasks
Common production tasks:
- Picture naming
- Sentence completion or elicitation

Common comprehension tasks:
- Lexical decision
- Self-paced reading
- Natural reading

Sometimes, a paradigm also include **(masked) priming**.

### Lexical access to the mental

## Some classic findings

### The organization of mental lexicon
Mental lexicon

Lexical access is affected by form and meaning similarity.
- A phonological neighborhood
- A semantic network
- Frequency
- Resting level of activation

### Parsing the input
Putting together words and morphemes into larger structures
- Parsing the ambiguities
- Garden-path sentences

## Production of spoken language

### Stage of speech production
- Planning stage:
  - Conceptualization: Formulate the ideas
  - Formulation: Select and arrange lexical items
- Execution stage

### Speech errors
- Spoonerisms exemplify errors in morphophonological encoding, and that planning units are larger than individual phonemes and morphemes.
- Other speech errors provide futher evidence that lexical items are organized by their meanings.

### The units of planning
Speech errors, pauses, and code-switching tell us about the units of planning during speech production. 

## Comprehension of spoken language
- constructing linguistic representation from a continuous signal.

### Identify phonemes
Like infants, we also need to overcome the segmentation and invariance problems.
- Segmentation problem
- Invariance problem

Assiging phones to phonemes as an example of
- Categorical perception, based on the underlying classification system (phonology of a language).

### Impact of linguistic knowledge
Studying speech is difficult because it is difficult to find an adequate comparison that is acoustically similar but not linguistically meaningful.
- A way has been use sinewave speech, only the coarse-grained acoustic properties of an utterance are retained, represented as sinewaves.
- Another way is called the Phoneme Restoration Effect.

### Speech is multisensory
We can only rely on the auditory signal, but when it come face to face conversation, we rely on the auditory signal and the visual signal. The **McGurk Effect** illustrate this.

Speech comprehension involves:
- constructing linguistic representations from a continuouts speech signal
- Use prior
- 

## Comprehension of written language
Spoken language is constrained temporally.

Reicher (1969) demostrated that we do not read letter-by-letter using the **Word Superiority Effect**. This tells us that language system can handle input. There is **Sentence Superiority Effect** as well.

## Bottom-up vs. Top-down processing

### Models
Comprehension (visual and auditory) must use both processes.

#### Bottom-up
Step by step process on the incoming signal, moving from phonemes to morphemes to words and phrases and semantic interpretation. Relies on sentory data
- Top-down processing, on the other hand, moves from the semantic interpretation downwards. Making informed guesses based on syntactic and semantic relation to narrow down the scope

**Transposed-Word Effect** illustrate the top-down process.
