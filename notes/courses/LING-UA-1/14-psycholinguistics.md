# Psycholinguistics
Study the mental processes that underlie linguistic behavior and how these are organized. More interested in linguistic performance rather than competence, at all the linguistic levels.

Psycholinguistics is concerned with all the linguistic levels, but areas like the organization of words (**the mental lexicon**) and syntactic processing (**parsing**) have traditionally received a lot of attention.


## What is psycholinguistics?
- How do we perceive linguistic information?
- How do we produce linguistic information?
- How is linguistic information (e.g., the mental lexicon) organized?
- How does extra linguistic factors influence linguistic processing?

### Data in psucholinguistics
- Rely on **behavioral data**, typically in controlled experiments.
- There is a comprehension-production asymmetry as comprehension is easier to study in general.

### Psycholinguistic tasks
Common production tasks:
- **Picture naming**
- **Sentence completion or elicitation**

Common comprehension tasks:
- **Lexical decision**
- **Self-paced reading**
- **Natural reading**

Sometimes, a paradigm also include **(masked) priming**.

## Some classic findings

### Lexical access to the mental lexicon
**Lexical Access**:= how we retrieve **lexical items** from our **mental lexicon** during both comprehension and production.
**Mental Lexicon**:= Dictionary of lexical items and how they are stored.

To generate sentences on the fly as we do, we need to access lexical idems (*memorized representation*, e.g., for the concept of a cat) from our mental lexicon, i.e., *the dictionary of lexical items* in the brain.

### The organization of mental lexicon
Lexical access is affected by form and meaning similarity:
- A **phonological neighborhood** (based on their form)
- A **semantic network** (based on their meaning)

Other factors affecting lexical access:
- Word's **frequency**: frequent -> higher **resting level of activation**.

### Parsing the input
**Parsing**:=  Putting together words and morphemes into larger structures. (alt. Determining the syntactic relations between words and phrases)
- Dealing with temporal ambiguities
- Garden-path sentences (ubiquotous, e.g., After the child visited the doctor *prescribed* a course of injections)

## Production of spoken language

### Stage of speech production
At a broad level, there are:
- **Planning stage**:
  - **Conceptualization**: Formulate the ideas
  - **Formulation**: Select and arrange lexical items
- **Execution stage**:
  - Body parts responsible are coordinated.

### Speech errors
Demonstrate how we plan at different levels of linguistic representations prior to
execution.

Examples:
- **Spoonerisms** exemplify errors in morphophonological encoding, and that planning units are larger than individual phonemes and morphemes.
- Other speech errors provide futher evidence that lexical items are organized by their meanings.

### The units of planning
Speech errors, pauses, and code-switching tell us about the units of planning during speech production.

One exception that can increase the chances of a syntactic structure being used, 
**syntactic priming**:= Induce an infrequent structure more frequently by priming participants with it. [^1]

[^1]: I guess people like to imitate whoever they are talking to.

## Comprehension of spoken language

### Stage of speech comprehension
At least three:
- Constructing linguistic representation from a continuous signal
- Using prior knowledge to construct linguistic representation
- Attending to a speech signal while ignoring noise.

### Identify phonemes
Like infants, we also need to overcome the segmentation and invariance problems. Recap:
- Segmentation problem: Segment a stream of speech into unique sounds.
- Invariance problem: Identify phonemes of their language despite hearing variation in how they are produced.

Assiging phones to phonemes as an example of
**Categorical perception**:= distinct sounds (phones) are categorized (into phonemes) based on the underlying classification system (phonology of a language).

### Impact of linguistic knowledge
Studying speech is difficult because it is difficult to find an adequate comparison that is acoustically similar but not linguistically meaningful.
- **Sinewave Speech**
  - only the coarse-grained acoustic properties of an utterance are retained.
  - represented as sinewaves.
- **Phoneme Restoration Effect**
  - fill in gaps in speech sounds.
  - demonstrate how we can overcome *speech signal interference*.

### Speech is multisensory
We rely on the auditory signal and the visual signal. The **McGurk Effect** illustrate this.

## Comprehension of written language

### Spoken vs. written language
- Spoken language is constrained temporally
  - Sequential processing of speech due to phonemes being sequential

### Reading is a parallel process

#### Word Superiority Effect
Reicher (1969) demostrated that we do not read letter-by-letter using the **Word Superiority Effect**.
- identification is more accurate when presented a word vs. a letter (in isolation/non-word)
- Processing a whole word is faster than processing one letter -> *do not process words letter-by-letter*

This tells us that language system can handle input in parallel.

#### Sentence Superiority Effect
There is **Sentence Superiority Effect** as well. 

We are faster and more accurate at recognizing structures (e.g., phrases or sentences)when presenting short strings of words together vs. unstructured (e.g., scrambled) strings of words.

## Bottom-up vs. Top-down processing

### Models
Comprehension (visual and auditory) must use both top-down and bottom-up processes.

#### Bottom-up
Step by step process on the incoming signal, moving from 
- phonemes -> morphemes -> words/phrases -> semantic interpretation
- Relies on sentory data.

#### Top-down
Moves from the semantic interpretation downwards.
- Guess based on syntactic and semantic relation to narrow down the scope of the potential input to be identified in the physical signal.
- Occur both with and without context.

**Transposed-Word Effect** illustrate the top-down process (to read: *'you read that wrong'* instead of *'you that read wrong'* even after seeing the latter version).
