# Morphology

## What is morphology?
Study of morphemes, smallest meaningful units in language.

### Morpheme vs. Phoneme
Phonemes are contrastive units of sounds, do not carry any meaning on their own.

### Morpheme vs. Syllable
A syllable is a prosodic unit based on sounds, not meaning.

### Morpheme vs. Word
Both have meanings.
- A word is a freestanding unit of meaning
  - can be simple, made up of a single morpheme
  - can be complex, made up of more than one morpheme.
- Morphemes are meaningful units that can, but don't have to, stand on their own.

### Meaning of morphemes
- Meaning of morpheme must be constant.
- Some morphemes sharing the same form may have multiple meanings.

### Form of morphemes
Sometimes, morphemes come in different forms, which is referred to as **allomorphs**.
- Form of a morpheme may change based on phonotactic rules.
- Other times, the different forms are remnants of older varieties of the language.
  - Despite the different realization, they are considered the same morpheme because the meaning is constant.

## Type of morphemes
Not all morphemes are created equal.

### Language specific
What's bound in one language can be free in another.

In English, most bound morphemes are affixes. Affixes are classified by where they attached to a word
- **Prefixes** attach to the beginning of a word
- **Suffixes** attach to the end of a word
- **Infixes** go in the middle of a word
- **Circumfixes** go around the word (on both sides)

### Roots vs. Stems
- Morphologically complex words consist of a **root** and one or more affixes.
- Some roots can stand along as a word.
- Other roots cannot stand alone as a word (so-called bound roots)
- When a root morpheme is combined with an affixm it forms a **stem**. Other affixes can be added to a stem to form a more complex stem.

## Morphological Analysis
Perform morphological analysis to identify morphemes.
Identify **recurring forms** with **recurring meanings**.

## Different types of words
Content words (open class words):
- Nouns
- Verbs
- Adjectives
- Adverbs

Function words (close class words):
- Conjunctions
- Prepositions
- Articles
- Pronoun
