# Semantics

## Defining semantics
Hypothesis 1: meanings are paraphrases (circular)  
Hypothesis 2: Meanings are concepts and ideas (Different ideas in different people's mind, hard to represent some words.)  
Hypothesis 3: Meanings are out in the world.

## Sentence meanings and truth conditions

### Truth is relative
Given a certain condition, we can judge the truth value of a sentence.  
We only need to know *what the world should be like* for a sentence to actually be true or false.

### Possible worlds
For each way the world *could have been*, there is a distinct possible world.  
Only talk about *logically* possible ways that would have turned out.  
Ex. $2 + 2 \neq 5$ (I was thinking this maybe could be true in a quaternary system, but then I realized 5 isn't even a defined digit under that. There is only $2_4 + 2_4 = 10_4$)

### Connectives
- negation *not* reverses the truth.
- logical connectives *and* require both conjuncts to be true.
- logical connectives *or* require one of the two conjuncts to be true.

## Composing meanings
### Establishing truth conditions
Meaning of a sentence is its truth conditions.
- Determining the meaning of a sentence by the meanings of the words it contains and the way they are combined. This is called the **principle of compositionality**.
- There is an order of operations establishing the conditions.

(The reason I think that there's the logical aspect, because the word in languages doesn't have a connection to it's meaning. So there is the need of building the logic constructively from ground up, not using established languages)

### Common semantic building blocks
- Names (proper nouns) refer to specific individuals in the world (**referent**)
- Common nouns refer to the *collection* of individuals in the world.
- Verb phrases that combine with a subject noun to form a sentence are called **predicates**.
    - Under what conditions it applies to any given individual.
    - What the world must be like for it to apply to any given individual.
    - In what kinds of logically possible situations it would be possible.

### Set theory
Venn diagrams to model the set of individuals.  
**Inclusive** and **Exclusive or**.  
but is logically equivalent to and, but it conveys an extra meaning of unexpectedness or contrast.

### Quantifiers
To relate predicates to other predicates, examples:
- every (subset)
- some (non-empty intersection)
- no (no intersection)
- numerals (exact quantity of the shared elements)

## Entailment
- When one sentence follows from another. 
  - (Implication that are one/two directional)
  - A formal definition of being **synonymous** (iff).
- When sentences are contradictory.
  - a formal definition of being **contradictions**

Relation of entailment is given just by the meaning of a sentence, independent of context. However, in actual conversation speakers often rely on context when communicating. More related to pragmatics.

## Presuppositions
Logically, presupposing some information.

### Triggers
1. Factive verbs
2. Definite determiners
3. Possessive case 's and possessive pronouns
4. Cleft sentences
5. Iterative (additive particles) such as *again* and *too*
6. Contrasts
7. Comparatives
8. Temporal (time word) classes
9. Change of state words
10. Counterfactual conditionals introduces by *if*

## Implicatures
What the listener can infer by reason based on what the speaker says in a given context.

Language as a **cooperative endeavor**.

### Grice's Maxims
What does the hearer assume the speaker is doing:
1. Maxim of Quality
   - **True**
   - Do not say what you believe is false. (lying)
   - Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
2. Maxim of Quantity
   - **Informative**
   - Informative as is required (for the current purpose of exchange).
   - Do not make it more informative than is required.
3. Maxim of Relevance
   - **Relevance**
4. Maxim of Manner
   - **Perspicuous/ Specific**
   - Avoid ambiguity
   - Avoid obscurity
   - Be brief
   - Be orderly

### Chatacteristic of implicatures
1. Implicatures are implied, not said.
2. Meaning is the result of the context.
3. Implicatures are **cancellable** or defeasible.

### Implicature vs. Entailment vs. Presupposition
- Implicature is possible to cancel, not the other two. 

```java
Does B have to be true regardless of the condition of A?
True: Presupposition
Does B have to be true if A is true?
True: Entailment
False: Implicature.
```

Entailment: B necessarily follows from A
Presupposition: Assumed background information
Implicature: Information you infer that is not necessarily explicit 

Understand:
- Meanings are out in the world
- Meaning of a sentence is its truth condition.
- Principle of compositionality
- Three different semantic relations

Do:
- Venn Diagrams
- Distinguish semantic relations
