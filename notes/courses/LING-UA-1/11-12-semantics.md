# Semantics

## Semantics vs. Pragmatics

## Defining semantics
Hypothesis 1: meanings are paraphrases (circular)  
Hypothesis 2: Meanings are concepts and ideas (Different ideas in different people's mind, hard to represent some words.)  
Hypothesis 3: Meanings are out in the world.

## Sentence meanings and truth conditions

### Truth is relative
Given a certain condition, we can judge the truth value of a sentence.  
We only need to know *what the world should be like* for a sentence to actually be true or false.

### Possible worlds
For each way the world *could have been*, there is a distinct possible world.  
Only talk about *logically* possible ways that would have turned out.  
Ex. $2 + 2 \neq 5$ (I was thinking this maybe could be true in a quaternary system, but then I realized 5 isn't even a defined digit under that. There is only $2_4 + 2_4 = 10_4$)

### Connectives
- negation *not* reverses the truth.
- logical connectives *and* require both conjuncts to be true.
- logical connectives *or* require one of the two conjuncts to be true.

## Composing meanings
### Establishing truth conditions
Meaning of a sentence is its truth conditions.
- Determining the meaning of a sentence by the meanings of the words it contains and the way they are combined. This is called the **principle of compositionality**.
- There is an order of operations establishing the conditions.

(The reason I think that there's the logical aspect, because the word in languages doesn't have a connection to it's meaning. So there is the need of building the logic constructively from ground up, not using established languages)

### Common semantic building blocks
- Names (proper nouns) refer to specific individuals in the world (**referent**)
- Common nouns refer to the *collection* of individuals in the world.
- Verb phrases that combine with a subject noun to form a sentence are called **predicates**.
    - Under what conditions it applies to any given individual.
    - What the world must be like for it to apply to any given individual.
    - In what kinds of logically possible situations it would be possible.

### Set theory
Venn diagrams to model the set of individuals.  
**Inclusive** and **Exclusive or**.  
but is logically equivalent to and, but it conveys an extra meaning of unexpectedness or contrast.

### Quantifiers
To relate predicates to other predicates, examples:
- every (subset)
- some (non-empty intersection)
- no (no intersection)
- numerals (exact quantity of the shared elements)

## Entailment
- When one sentence follows from another. 
  - (Implication that are one/two directional)
  - A formal definition of being **synonymous** (iff).
- When sentences are contradictory.
  - a formal definition of being **contradictions**

Relation of entailment is given just by the meaning of a sentence, independent of context. However, in actual conversation speakers often rely on context when communicating. More related to pragmatics.
