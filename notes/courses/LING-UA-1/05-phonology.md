# Phonology (Continued)

Human have the tendency to increase the place of articulation.

## Phonological Rules

Some common phonological processes:
- **Assimilation**: two nearby sounds become more similar.
  - Ex. In English, nasals undergo assimilation
  - Plurals have the same process (classification with sibilant and voicing)
- **Dissimilation**: two nearby sounds become more different.
- **Insertion** (epenthesis) : Adding a phone.
- **Deletion**: An underlying phoneme is removed when pronouncing a word. (Some rules govern these behaviours)
- **Metathesis**: Two sounds are switched.
