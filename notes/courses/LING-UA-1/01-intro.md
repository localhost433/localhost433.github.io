Overview of what will be covered in the course.

# What is Language?
- Cultural artifact
- Articulation of thoughts
- Code for communication
- Human biological trait

## How does language work?
- Language as a mapping
    ```
    form                 <->               function
    sound/sign <-> words <-> sentences <-> meaning
    ```
- What exactly do we know when we say we 'know' a language?

## What does it mean to 'know' a language

### Linguistic competence
- Our knowledge of sounds, words, linguistic structures, linguistic
meanings, etc.
- Mostly unconscious

#### vs... Linguistic performance
- The way people use languages, including errors.

#### Knowledge of sound patterns: Phonetics
- Inventory of sounds
  - Which sounds exists in the language?
  - Which sounds are meaningfully distinct from others?
- Which sounds can occur where
  - Where in a word/syllable?
  - In sequence with which other sounds?

#### Knowledge of Word patterns: Morphology
[Morpheme:= smallest meaningful unit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme)

#### Knowledge of sentence patterns: Syntax

#### Knowledge of meaning patterns: Semantics
Logical implication for the sentence.

### Communicative competence
- Our knowledge of how and when to use those linguistic structures.
- Our evaluations ((un)/conscious) of others’ linguistic (in)competence
and linguistic performance.

#### Knowledge of usage patterns: Sociolinguistics
Association of meaning with the words

## Key features of language
1. Arbitrariness
   No inherent connection between the word and the object, just **convention**.
2. Displacement
   Use language to communicate about things that are unrelated to (or distant from) the here and now.
3. Discreteness
   Made up of discrete units: sounds, words, phrases, etc.
4. Hierarchical
   Discrete units combine to form larger units, and larger units combine to form even larger units.
5. Creativity
   Use language to form an infinite set of well-formed, grammatical sentences.
6. Rule-Governedness
   - Follow a set of conventional rules (grammar).
   - Govern how linguistic units are constructed and how they fit together.
   - (Include "non-standard" dialects and slangs as well)

**There are no distinction between dialect and language in linguistics.**

## What exactly is Linguistics?
- Scientific study of language
  - Unconscious knowledge we have
  - the way we learn language
  - structure of language and of particular languages
  - how languages vary
  - how language is used in society

### Descriptivism vs. Prescriptivism
- Descriptive grammar: description or model of the mental grammar, what speaker know about their language.
- Prescriptive Grammar: attempts to prescribe what rules of language people should use to speak “properly”.

**Linguists don’t tell people how to speak. They observe how people actually speak and try to understand why.**
