## Language Variation

---

### What is language variation

---

#### Terminology
- **Lect**: A variety of a language
- **Idiolect**: the variety of a language spoken by a single individual
- **Dialect**: the variety of a language shared by a geographical area
- **Sociolect**: the variety of a language with social features
- **Ethnolect**: a variety of a language linked with a set of racialized features.
- **Dialect Continuum**
- **Isogloss**: line on map between two features.
- **Dialect Levelling**: movement toward greater uniformity.

---

#### Not two speakers speak the same way
Speakers can vary across:
- Lexicon
- Grammatical Rules (phonetic/phonological, morphological, semantic, syntactic)

Speakers vary based on Macrosocial categories:
- Age, generation
- Sex, gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Socioeconomic Status etc.
Also Microsocial categories, such as locally specific social variables.

**Language variation** is
- *pervasive* in that it occurs across all people.
- *systematic* in that variation is structured (not random)
- *meaningful* in that variants are associated with different social meanings.

---

#### Shared Norms
- Across a given group, tend to be a shared set of linguistic and social norms.
- Everyone speaks a different **variety** of a language (and many people use several varieties across different contexts).
- Some variety emerges as the **"standard" variety** in a given context.

---

#### Standard vs. "Non-Standard"
A "standard" variety:
- Associated with the dominant social/political group (*elite*)
- Is used in formal settings
- Is taught to L2 learners
- Closest to the written form of the language
- Closest to the prescriptve norms of the language
- Has **overt prestige**.

A "non-standard" variety:
- Can be associated with non-dominant groups (e.g., working class, certain gender, etc.)
- Is not used in formal settings
- Does not usually have overt prestige, may have **covert prestige**.

---

#### "Covert" vs. "Overt" Prestige
Covert Prestige
- Hidden or community-based recognition
- Linked to non-standard varieties and local identities
- Conveys solidarity, group membership, or resistance to the mainstream

Overt prestige
- Publicly recognized and rewarded
- Linked to the standard variety and institutional norms
- Valued in education, media, and formal domains

---

#### How is the "Standard" Established
- A standard variety is determined by social, economic, historical etc. factors, not because any linguistic features
- A given linguistic feature is never inherently “standard” / “non-standard
- Social context dynamically assigns perceptions of “standardness” or “non-standardness” to certain features
- Sometimes norms are implemented by some governing body, such as la Real Academia Española (RAE), l'Académie Française, but not always.

---

#### Standard is arbitrary
- Standard British English, SBE (aka. Received pronounciation, RP) omits /ɹ/ when not followed by a vowel, and RP is considered "standard".
- But in US, dialects that does this is considered "non-standard" (e.g., Boston English)
- What considered a "standard" dialect has a social basis, not a linguistic one.
  - AAE has *aks* for *ask*
  - SAE has *comftable* for *comfortable*
  - But only AAE is subject to negative stereotyping in US.

---

### Analyzing the Variation

---

#### Varieties are *systematic* in their differences
- linguists investigate these differences by looking at linguistic variables
- Variables can be:
  - Phonetic/Phonological
  - Lexical (semantic)
  - Morphological
  - Syntactic
  - Semantic
  - Pragmatic

---

#### Terminology
**Variable**:= The thing that varies
**Variants**:= The possible realizations of the thing that varies
**Envelope of variation**:= The (linguistic) environements in which the variation can occur

---

#### Example: Phonological Variation
- Standard American English (SAE) vs. some varieties of Southern English
  - /ɑ͡ɪ/ monophthongization
    - Variable: Vowel /ɑ͡ɪ/
    - Variants: [ɑ͡ɪ] and [a]
    - Envelope of variation: Stressed Syllables
  - Rhoticity
    - Variable: The phone /ɹ/
    - Variants: [ɹ] and null [∅]
    - Envelope of variation: Coda position (and not pre-vocalic (?))

---

#### Example: Lexical variation
- Standard American English (SAE) vs. Standard British English (SBE)
  - SAE *elevator* vs. SBE *lift*
    - Variable: The word meaning ‘that thing that takes you between floors'
    - Variants: *elevator* and *lift*
    - Envelope of variation: Any position where you want to refer to ‘that thing that takes you between floors'
- Intensifiers
  - SAE *very* vs. (S)BE *bloody*
  - vs. NorCal English *hella*
  - vs. NYC English *mad*
    - Variable: Intensifiers
    - Variants: *very*, *bloody*, *hella* etc.
    - Envelope of variation: Any position where you can use an intensifier.

---

#### Example: Syntactic Variation
- Appalachian English vs. SAE
  - Double Modals
    - Variable: Modal Constructions
    - Variants: *might should* vs. *should* , *should ought* vs. *ought*, etc.
    - Envelope of variation: Anywhere you can use a modal.
  - Double Objects
    - Variable: Object Constructions
    - Variants: *‘a fish*’ vs. ‘*me a fish*’ etc. → ‘OBJ’ vs. ‘OBJ + OBJ'
    - Envelope of variation: After transitive verbs

---

#### Example: Morphological Variation
- Appalachian English vs. SAE
  - a-prefixing
    - Variable: a-prefixing
    - Variants: *a*- or null
    - Envelope of variation: Before -ing verbs with initial stres

---

#### Example: Pragmatic Variation
- Southern American English vs. SAE
  - Yes ma’am/sir
    - Variable: Terms of Address
    - Variants: *ma’am/sir* vs. null
    - Envelope of variation: In response to a question, when speaking to senior, etc.

### Case Studies
Linguistic Profiling - Purnell et al., 1999

---

#### African American English

---

##### Terminology
- African American English (AAE)
- African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
- African American Language (AAL)
- Ebonics

---

##### What is AAE?
Dialect spoken by a large population of Americans of African descent
But
- Not all African Americans speak AAE
- Not only African American speak AAE
- There are Black Englishes other than AAE

---

##### Where does AAE come from
Two main hypotheses about the origins of AAE:
- Anglicist hypotheses: AAE developed from features of various British English dialects (specifically those from the British Isles)
- Creolist hypotheses: AAE devekoped from the extended contact between English and various West African languages (e.g., Yoruba)

Most linguists today adopt a creolist hypothesis.

---

##### Phonological Features
- “Th”-stopping: in certain environments where SAE uses /ð/, AAE uses /d/
- Consonant Cluster Simplification/Reduction


---

##### Morphological Features
- Possessives
  - SAE forms possessives by adding the suffix -s to the possessor
  - AAE does not require this morpheme on the possessor
- 3rd-Person Agreement
  - In SAE, the agreement morpheme -s is added to the verb when the subject is 3rd person singular
  - AAE does not require this morpheme

---

##### Syntactic Features
- Negative Concord (common cross linguistically)
- Copula Dropping
- Habitual be
- Stressed been/bin

---

#### Chicano English

---

##### What is Chicano English(ChE)?
Dialect spoken by many Mexican Americans in California and the Southwestern region of the US
- Many ChE speakers (and AAE speakers) are bidialectal, which means they use both ChE and SAE depending on the context
  - Code-switching
  - Translanguaging, Translingual Practice
- ChE is not just English with a Spanish accent; it has specific features and, like any dialect, is rule-governed

---

##### Phonological Features
- Word-final /z/ devoicing: Where SAE uses [z], ChE uses [s]
- Less vowel reduction than SAE
- Like AAE, ChE simplifies/reduces word-final consonant cluster

---

##### Syntactic Features
- Negative Concord

---

##### Semantic Features
- *barely* -> 'just'
- *borrow* -> 'lend'

---

##### How broad is this term?
- Norteño/a, Sureño/a
- Latino/a English
- Latinx English
- Hispanic English
- Nuyorican English
- Cholo/a etc.

---

---

### Linguistic Discrimination in Education

---

#### The Ebonics Controversy (Oakland, 1996)
Children who speak a dialect of English other than SAE, may be at a disadvantage in school (where SAE tends to be the Language Of Instruction, and also the Object Of Instruction)
- One approach is to discourage students from speaking AAE/ChE/etc. and to present SAE as superior
  - This has been criticized as damaging and impractical, and it does not lead to improved learning outcomes
- Another approach is to encourage **bidialectalism**
  - Encourages children to take pride in their non-SAE dialect, while also promoting their proficiency in SAE
  - Recognizes potential cognitive advantages, metalinguistic strategies, etc.

## Language and Style

---

### Foundational notions
Two dimensions of variation in langugage:
1. <cyan>**Inter-speaker**</cyan> = variation that patterns by user  
2. <red>**Intra-speaker**</red> = variation that patterns by use  
   - <orange>**Style**</orange>  
     - <purple>**Register**</purple>: language associated with a particular occupational or social group; may contain <green>**jargon**</green>
       - <blue>**genre**</blue>: register with a conventional structure

---

### Register
e.g., legalese
e.g., sports announcer play-by-play commentar
    <cyan>Bases loaded</cyan>, <purple>swing and a miss</purple>. <red>One and one</red>. 
e.g., meeting royalty
    Address Queen as <purple>Your Majesty</purple>, other royals as <red>Your Royal Highness</red>

---

### Foundational Notions
There are no single style speakers:
everyone engages in **style-shifting**

---

### Style as Attention Paid to Speech

---

#### Style-shifting by task & context of speech

Some Methodologies:
- Sociolinguistic Interview
  - Guided conversation
  - Reading passage
  - Word list
  - Minimal pairs
- Rapid and Anonymous Survey

---

##### Labov’s NYC Department Store Study
William Labov - University of Pennsylvania

Some Key Results:
- Higher rates of ‘r’ word-finally than pre-consonantally
- Rhoticity shows class stratification (higher SES, more ‘r’)
- Higher rates of ‘r’ in emphatic vs. casual speech

---

#### Findings

The <red>more closely</red> speakers monitor their speech, the more they shift into <cyan>formal styles</cyan>, characterized as speech that resembles that of <purple>high-prestige social groups</purple>.

Variants' usage can shift over time:
- Change from above
- Change from below
  - <pink>Indicator</pink>
    - No style-shifting
    - No conscious awareness
  - <red>Marker</red>
    - Style-shifting appears
    - Some awareness
  - <scarlet>Stereotype</scarlet>
    - Style-shifting
    - Conscious awareness

---

#### Limitations of the Attention-Paid-to-Speech Model
- "Attention" is difficult to define & quantify
- Speecific to sociolinguistic interview tasks
  - How do we think about reframing this model when dealing with more naturalistic speech contexts?

---

### Style as Audience Design
Speakers design their speech <red>toward their audience</red>.

---

#### Accommodation
- Convergence
- Divergence

Task effects -> Audience effects

---

#### Bell's Style Axiom
Allan Bell - Auckland University of Technology

“Variation on the style dimension within the speech of a single speaker derives from and echoes the variation which exists between speakers on the ‘social’ dimension." (Bell 1984)

---

#### Hypercorrection

---

### Style as Speaker Design
Speakers adjust their speech <red>agentively</red>, selecting variants depending on their <cyan>social associations</cyan>, to express different <purple>attitudes</purple>, different aspects of their <orange>identities</orange>, etc.

---

#### Jocks & Burnouts
Penny Eckert - Stanford University

Eckert’s research site:
“Belten” High School, suburban Detroit, MI

Data collection via <cyan>participant observation</cyan> and <red>ethnography</red>.

What affects students’ language at Belten High?
- Parents’ social class?
- Sex/Gender?
- Social group affiliation?
