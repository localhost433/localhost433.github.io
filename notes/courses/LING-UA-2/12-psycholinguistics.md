# Overview: Names vs Other Words

**Questions**
- How do we **perceive** and **produce** names?
- Are names processed differently from other nouns?

**Background**
- Throughout the course we’ve seen names behave like ordinary words:
  - **Phonology**: They follow sound patterns and constraints.
  - **Morphology**: They can be built from pieces, respond to blending, truncation, etc.
  - **Sociolinguistics**: They encode class, ethnicity, fashion, and change over time.

**Psycholinguistic twist**
- Names are also **deeply tied to the self**, and this affects:
  - Preferences,
  - Memory,
  - Attention,
  - Error patterns (e.g. tip-of-the-tongue).

# The Name-Letter Effect & Implicit Egotism

## Name-letter effect (Nuttin 1985)

**Observation**
- People tend to rate letters that appear in **their own name** as more **attractive**.
- For example, someone named *John* may especially like J, O, H, N letters.

**Interpretation**
- Our own name is highly familiar and emotionally salient.
- Positive feelings toward our self can “spill over” to the letters composing our name.

## Implicit egotism (Simonsohn 2011 and others)

**Idea**
- We may subconsciously prefer:
  - Places, careers, and partners whose names resemble **our own name**.
- For example, people named *Dennis* becoming dentists, or living in cities sharing initials.

**Evidence and criticism**
- Some early correlational findings suggested such patterns.
- Later work (e.g. Simonsohn) re-examined data, arguing:
  - Many early effects may be **weaker** or **statistical artifacts**.
  - But the general idea that **self-related stimuli** (like our own name) shape preferences remains important.

# Names and the Self: Perception & Attention

## Attitudinal tasks (Hodson & Olson 2005)

**Design**
- Participants rate how much they like:
  - Animals (beaver, rabbit, lion),
  - Foods (rice, lemon, garlic),
  - Leisure activities (fishing, camping, soccer),
  - Etc.
- Researchers test whether items sharing **initial letters** with participants’ first names are rated more positively.

**Finding**
- Small but systematic tendency to favor items that **match** one’s own initials.
- Supports the idea that **self-related features** influence preferences.

## Cocktail party effect

**Phenomenon**
- In a noisy room, we can selectively attend to relevant speech.
- Our own name is **especially salient**:
  - People often detect their name even when it appears in unattended conversation.

**Development**
- Evidence suggests an **own-name advantage** for attention emerges early:
  - Infants around ~5 months show special responses to their name.

# Infants, Names & the Head-Turn Preference Paradigm

**Method**
- Infants sit on a caregiver’s lap, facing a central light.
- A side light blinks; when the infant looks at it, auditory stimulus plays.
- Measure how long infants **orient** toward different sounds (e.g. their own name vs other words).

**Findings**
- Infants show **longer orientation** to their own name than to other words.
- Suggests:
  - Names are learned very early,
  - They quickly become powerful **attention cues**.

# Names vs Other Nouns: Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) & Retrieval

## Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) states

**Definition**
- A state in which:
  - You know you **know** a word (e.g. a person’s name),
  - You can access partial information (e.g. initial letter, syllable count),
  - But you cannot fully retrieve it in the moment.

**Proper names and TOT**
- Proper names (especially **people’s names**) are:
  - More likely to produce TOT states,
  - Harder to retrieve than common nouns referring to similar entities.

**Why?**
- Proper names are often:
  - **Semantically “light”** (they do not describe properties; they just label).
  - Less embedded in a **network of meaning** (unlike *teacher*, *hammer*, etc.).
- A missing link anywhere in the retrieval path can make the whole name unavailable.

## Names vs labels

- Words can function as:
  - **Names** (rigid designators tied to a specific individual), or
  - **Labels** (category words with rich semantic networks).
- Pure names rely more on a direct link from **concept -> arbitrary sound pattern**, which may be more fragile.

---

# Summary

- Names are processed both as **ordinary linguistic objects** and as **special self-related cues**.
- Psycholinguistic evidence shows:
  - We show **preferences** for our own names and their letters,
  - Our names attract **attention** (cocktail party effect, infant studies),
  - Proper names are especially prone to **retrieval difficulty** (TOT).
- These patterns help explain why names feel:
  - Emotionally powerful,
  - Sometimes frustratingly hard to recall,
  - And central to our sense of identity.
