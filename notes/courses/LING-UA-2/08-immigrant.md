## Myth-busting: Ellis Island name changes

- Common myth: “Officials at Ellis Island **changed immigrants’ names**.”
- Historical evidence contradicts this:
  - Inspectors used **ship manifests**; they did **not** independently re-record names.
  - After 1924, visas and names were recorded **in advance** by US consular officials.
- In reality:
  - Many immigrants **changed their own names**:
    - Before travel, or
    - After arrival, as they adjusted to US/Canadian life.
- “Ellis Island” thus became a metaphor for the **whole early immigrant experience**:
  - Navigating the city, learning English, finding work/housing, schooling, and
  - **Adjusting names** to new spellings/pronunciations.

## 20th-century family naming choices

### Assimilation and Anglo names

- In the US and Canada, many families:
  - Adopted **Anglo given names** to **assimilate**.
  - Replaced “impossible” or stigmatized names with “American” ones.
- Example from Mary Antin’s memoir *The Promised Land*:
  - A committee of more “Americanized” friends chose English names for new arrivals.
  - Some names were translated or approximated; others were replaced while keeping **initials**.
  - Shows both **pressure to conform** and **emotional cost** (loss of desired “special” names).

### “Official” vs “home” names

- Interviews with Italian and Jewish families show:
  - Children might have **ethnic names** used at home,
  - But only **Anglo names** were used at school/work.
- Census data, however, reveal **persistence** of many Italian names:
  - Top names among Italian immigrants overlap partially with **mainstream** white names (e.g. Mary, Joseph) but also include strongly **Italian forms** (Carmela, Salvatore, etc.).
  - So assimilation is **partial**, not total.

## East and Southeast Asian naming patterns

- Major factors (e.g. Wu 1999, Louie 1985):

1. **Transliteration**
   - Mismatched **sound inventories** and **loss of tones** when mapping to English.
   - Leads to multiple possible spellings.

2. **Americanization**
   - Choosing an English name that is a **loose phonetic match**:
     - e.g. *Soo Fei -> Fay*, *Wei Lim -> William*, *Teong -> Ted*, *Mei Guen -> Mae Gwen*, *Yoon -> June*.
   - Surnames sometimes respelled to look more “English”:
     - *Fan -> Fann*, *Lam -> Lamm*, *Lin -> Lynn*, *Go -> Goe*, *Hsu -> Hsue*.

3. **Translation**
   - Occasionally, children receive an English name that **translates** the meaning of the Chinese name (e.g. naming “Iris” for a Chinese name meaning ‘orchid’).

4. **Name order and “changers”**
   - Many Asian systems place **family name first**.
   - Some immigrants **reorder** names to match Western convention.
   - Studies of “name changers” vs “non-changers” show:
     - Changers may have **more American social networks** and consume less media in the heritage language.

## Late 20th / 21st-century trends

### Gender and assimilation (Spanish–English)

- Work with Los Angeles county data (1990s):
  - Parents often faster to give **daughters** English/assimilated names.
  - Sons more likely to carry **family-line** names.
- “Translatable” names:
  - e.g. **José / Joseph**, **María / Mary**.
  - Some families pick forms that **work in both languages** or have direct equivalents.

### Ethiopian immigrants in the US

- Parents balance:
  - Desire for children to **“fit in”** and avoid stigma, and
  - Desire to **signal Ethiopian or Oromo identity**.
- Strategies:
  - Choosing **Biblical names** common in both Ethiopia and the US (e.g. Michael, Ruth).
  - Choosing Ethiopian names that are:
    - Short,
    - **Easy for Americans to pronounce**, and
    - Still meaningful in the heritage language.
- Oromo families may use the US context as an opportunity to **reclaim Oromo names**, after constraints in Ethiopia that favored dominant-group names.

## Immigrant names in Anglo culture

### Pressures to conform

- Qualitative work in Canadian cities (e.g. London, Ontario) identifies "forces of conformity":
  1. **Employment pressure** – belief that an “easier” or more Anglo-sounding name helps with hiring.
  2. **School & peer pressure** – desire not to stand out or be teased.
  3. **Avoiding constant explanations** – fatigue from spelling, correcting pronunciation, etc.
  4. **Institutional forms** – systems that cannot easily handle diacritics or long/complex names.
  5. **Microaggressions** – recurrent misnaming or uninvited shortening (e.g. teachers renaming students without consent).

- Some immigrants respond by:
  - Adopting an **Anglo nickname**,
  - Simplifying spelling, or
  - Using **different names in different contexts** (home vs work/school).

## Names and employment outcomes (pointer)

Audit-style evidence on name-based discrimination in hiring (resumes, email requests, callbacks) is summarized in [Naming & Bias](https://robinc.vercel.app/note.html?course=LING-UA-2&note=10-bias). This note focuses on the **pressures and strategies** that shape immigrant naming choices.

## Takeaways

- Immigrant naming is shaped by:
  - **Historical myths** (like Ellis Island) vs. the real, self-driven process of name change.
  - Pressures of **assimilation**, **identity**, and **legibility** in host societies.
- Name choices are **strategic**:
  - To avoid discrimination,
  - To maintain heritage links,
  - Or to balance both.
- Empirical studies show that names can significantly affect **employment prospects**, revealing **structural biases** even when qualifications are held constant.
