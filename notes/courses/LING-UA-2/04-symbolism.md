# Sound Symbolism

**Warm-up (Bouba/Kiki)**  
Two shapes, two names. One is *bouba*, one is *kiki*.

**Definition**  
*Sound symbolism*: when a sound or pattern of sounds “expresses a certain meaning directly and intrinsically.”  
This challenges the traditional notion of the *arbitrariness of the sign* (that sound↔meaning pairings are mostly conventional, not iconic).

## Cross-linguistic tendencies

**Size**  
High/front vowels and palatal/voiceless segments often feel “smaller,” while low/back vowels and voiced/stop segments often feel “larger.”  
Illustrations in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, Greek, Ewe).

**Proximity**  
Pairs like “this” vs. “that” often show vowel contrasts that pattern with near vs. far across languages (English, French, German, Malay).

**Emotion and connotation**  
Clusters with [ʌ] in English (e.g., *mud, grumble, ugh*) skew toward “heavy/dull/negative” meanings.

**Shape (rounded vs. angular)**  
Bouba/kiki mappings: round sounds (e.g., /b, m, l, o, u/) -> round shapes; sharp sounds (e.g., /k, t, i, e/) -> spiky shapes.

*All of the above are tendencies, not hard rules.*

## Names show sound symbolism too

**Domains**  
- **Animal names**: systematic differences track perceived creature properties.  
- **Chosen names / nicknames**: speakers pick sounds that match desired persona.  
- **Invented names (e.g., Pokémon)**: systematic correlations with in-world size/power.

## Evidence from studies highlighted in class

**Baseball player names (1920–2017)**  
“League-registered” first names show measurable correlations between phonology and player size proxies:  
- More high vowels / shorter names / more sonorants often pattern with perceived “smaller/lighter” impressions, and vice versa.  
Interpretation: when people select the public form of their name, they (probabilistically) align sound patterns with identity cues.

**Pokémon across languages**  
Correlations between name phonology and character **size/power**:  
- Longer names, more voiced obstruents -> higher power.  
- Fewer sonorants / different place features track with evolutionary stage.  
- In Japanese data, more **labial** consonants associate with *smaller/cuter* items (mirrors broader Japanese branding tendencies).

**“Round” vs. “sharp” names and gendered perception**  
Experimental tasks with novel names:  
- “Round-sounding” names (e.g., /b, l, m, n, u, o, ɑ/) are more often judged as fitting round/soft characters and are perceived as more feminine.  
- “Sharp-sounding” names (e.g., /k, p, t, i, e, ɛ, ʌ/) map to angular characters and are perceived as more masculine.  
Hypothesis: cultural associations (e.g., size dimorphism) + articulatory/acoustic cues -> implicit gendered expectations.

## In-class activities

1. **Bouba/Kiki on Names**  
Given pairs like *Milo* vs. *Kai*, *Noelle* vs. *Tia*, decide: round vs. sharp, and match to shapes. Explain which segments drove your judgment.

2. **Nickname design**  
Design a nickname that shifts the persona of a base name along a size/softness axis (e.g., from “tough/edgy” -> “cute/approachable”). Document which phonological changes you used and why.

3. **Mini corpus test**  
Take a list of names partitioned by gender from a public top-names list. Compute quick proxies:  
- Number of high vowels, number of sonorants, number of voiced obstruents, length (in segments).  
Report which features differ by group and whether they match the tendencies above.

## Takeaways

- Sound symbolism provides **probabilistic** mappings from form -> meaning (size, shape, emotion, social categories).  
- These mappings appear in **names** because names are curated social signals.  
- Effects are cross-linguistic but **not universal** and are mediated by culture, phonotactics, and orthography.  
- Good practice: treat them as testable hypotheses, not rules.
