# Broader patterns in Naming & Gender

**Cross-linguistic cues**
- Many languages use overt gender markers in names (e.g., Latin **-a** vs. **-us**; Lahu **cà-** vs. **nā-**).

**English tendencies (probabilistic)**
- Female names more likely to **start with a vowel**, **end in a vowel**, and be **longer** or **iambic**; male names more likely to end in a consonant or have voicing patterns that differ in initial segments.  
- Are these still visible today? Use the datasets above to test.

**Psycholinguistic evidence**
- Listeners use stress/length/finality cues to infer a novel name’s gender; such knowledge parallels other category-sound correlations (e.g., noun/verb stress biases).

# Trends

**Task 1 - Final-sound “genderedness” (Barry & Harper scale)**
- Score each unique name by final sound:  
  +2 -> ends in [ə]; +1 -> ends in any other vowel; 0 -> final liquid/nasal; −1 -> final fricative/affricate; −2 -> final stop.  
- Then *Insert -> Pivot table* on **Top 10 by decade**: **Rows -> Year**, **Columns -> Sex**, **Values -> Average(B&H scale)** -> *Insert -> Chart*.  
- Interpret: Do average scores by sex drift over 1890–2020?

**Task 2 - Syllable count**
- Enter **syllables per name** -> pivot (**Rows -> Year**, **Columns -> Sex**, **Values -> Average(syllables)**) -> chart.  
- Compare trajectories with Task 1.
