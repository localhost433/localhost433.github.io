# Brand Names

## Overview

These notes bring together two class sessions on how **brand names** work in natural language. We look at:

1. **Phonology** – how sounds and pronounceability shape perception.
2. **Morphology** – how names are built from smaller pieces (blends, compounds, affixes).
3. **Meaning** – connotation, metaphor, and metonymy in names.
4. **Language change & ethics** – how social norms force names to change.
5. **Drug naming** – why pharmaceutical brand names look and sound the way they do.

The main idea: brand naming is not random. Sound patterns, word structure, and meaning all interact with culture, law, and marketing strategy.

---

## Phonology and Brand Names

### Sound symbolism: basic idea

- **Sound symbolism**: when a sound or sound pattern is perceived as directly linked to some meaning (e.g. size, sharpness, speed), rather than being completely arbitrary.
- Earlier work on **sound symbolism in names** (for people, animals, etc.) suggested patterns like:
  - High/front vowels (e.g. [i]) → “small, light, sharp”.
  - Low/back vowels (e.g. [ɑ]) → “big, heavy, round”.
  - Certain consonants also pattern with “round vs. sharp” impressions.
- Question: Do these patterns carry over to **brand names**, especially nonsense ones?

---

### Klink (2000): phonetic symbolism in brand naming

**Method**

- Participants saw:
  - A **product type** + an **attribute** (e.g. “mild soap”, “sharp knife”).
  - A pair of **nonsense words** (e.g. *revep* vs. *ruvep*, *folb* vs. *kolb*).
- They chose which name better fit the product/attribute.
- Manipulations:
  - Front vs. back vowels.
  - Fricatives vs. stops.
  - Voiced vs. voiceless stops.
  - Voiced vs. voiceless fricatives.

**Findings (simplified)**

- **Front vowels** tended to fit products that are:
  - Smaller, faster, lighter, sharper, more “feminine”.
- **Back vowels** tended to fit products that are:
  - Larger, heavier, slower, fuller/richer.
- Voicing and manner (fricative vs. stop) also showed some consistent patterns, although not every hypothesis was perfectly supported.

**Takeaway**

- Even in made-up brand names, specific sound properties systematically bias people toward certain interpretations (size, weight, sharpness, etc.).

### Yorkston & Menon (2004): ice cream names

**Question**

- Can a single vowel change affect how people experience a **real product** (ice cream)?
- Example contrast: **Frish** [i] vs. **Frosh** [ɑ].

**Idea**

- [i] has associations like “small, light, crisp, cold”.
- [ɑ] has associations like “large, heavy, warm, rich”.
- They tested whether people perceive the ice cream differently (e.g. lighter vs. richer) depending on whether it’s called *Frish* vs. *Frosh*.

**Takeaway**

- Even when eating **actual ice cream**, name sound can affect judgments of:
  - Richness vs. lightness.
  - Coldness vs. warmth.
  - “Indulgent treat” vs. “light, refreshing”.

---

### Lowrey & Shrum (2007): generalizing sound symbolism

Yorkston & Menon studied one product and one vowel pair. Lowrey & Shrum tested:

1. Whether vowel symbolism generalizes across **many products**.
2. How people react to vowels reported as **“unpleasant”** (e.g. [ju]) vs. more “positive” vowels.

#### Vowel contrasts

- **Front vs. back** vowel pairs in nonsense names:
  - e.g. *gimmel/gommel*, *tiddip/toddip*, *pinner/ponner*.
- **Positive vs. “unpleasant”** vowels:
  - e.g. *pawdex/pewdex*, *mawlad/mewlad* (contrast [ɑ] vs. [ju]).

#### Experiment 1: multiple product types

- Participants saw each name pair with a **product** and **attribute**, such as:
  - Two-seater convertible vs. SUV.
  - Knife vs. hammer.
- They chose which name best matched each product.

**Patterns**

- Front vowels → preferred for **smaller/faster/lighter/sharper** products.
- Back vowels → preferred for **larger/slower/heavier/richer** products.
- “Positive” vowels (like [ɑ]) were consistently preferred over [ju]-words, across product types.

#### Experiment 2: beers

- Same vowel contrasts, now used for **beer**:
  - One beer described as *cold, clean, crisp*.
  - The other as *smooth, mellow, rich*.

**Results**

- Front vowels fit the “cold/clean/crisp” beer better.
- Back vowels fit the “smooth/mellow/rich” beer better.
- “Unpleasant” [ju] vowels were disfavored overall.

**Overall takeaway**

- Sound symbolism effects generalize across different products.
- Not all vowels are equal: some are liked or disliked no matter what the product is.

### Unconventional spelling: vowelless brand names

**Study idea**

- Many modern brands use **vowelless** names (e.g. *RNGNR*) for a “cool” or techy look.
- Pathak & Motoki tested how English speakers evaluate **vowelless vs. vowelled** brand names along personality dimensions.

**Method**

- Participants evaluated pairs like:
  - *Rngnr* vs. *Ringner*.
  - *Lntrm* vs. *Lintrum*.
- Product: snack brands (chocolates or chips), supposedly for a non-English-speaking market.
- Rated each on personality traits:
  - Competence (reliable, intelligent, successful).
  - Sophistication (upper-class, charming).
  - Sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, cheerful).
  - Ruggedness (outdoorsy, tough).
  - Excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, up-to-date).

**Results**

- Vowelled names generally scored higher on:
  - Competence, sophistication, sincerity, excitement.
- Vowelless names:
  - Sometimes scored a bit higher on **toughness** but not clearly on outdoorsiness.
- For food-related traits, vowelled names tended to be favored or showed no advantage for vowelless forms.

**Takeaway**

- Vowelless spellings create a distinct visual style but can make brands seem:
  - Less competent, less sincere, less “nice”.
  - Slightly more rugged/edgy in some contexts.

### Pronounceability and perceived risk: Song & Schwartz (2009)

**Core idea**

- How *easy a name is to pronounce* can influence judgments of:
  - Safety vs. danger.
  - Dullness vs. adventurousness.

#### Study 1: food additives

- Participants rated food additives on harmfulness (1–7):
  - Easy names (e.g. *Magnalroxate*).
  - Hard names (e.g. *Hnegripitrom*).
- Harder-to-pronounce names were judged **more harmful** on average.

#### Study 2: amusement park rides

- Participants rated ride names along:
  1. **Safety** (very safe → very risky).
  2. **Excitement** (very dull → very adventurous).

- Easy vs. hard ride names:
  - Easy: *Chunta, Ohanzee, Tihkoosue*.
  - Hard: *Vaiveahtoishi, Tsiischili, Heammawihio*.

**Findings**

- On the safety scale: harder names were judged **riskier**.
- On the excitement scale: harder names could be judged **more adventurous**.

**Takeaway**

- Hard-to-pronounce names add a sense of **risk/danger**:
  - Bad for things like food additives and medicines.
  - Potentially good for thrill rides or “extreme” sports products.

---

## Morphology in Brand Names

### Why morphology?

- **Morphology**: the structure of words, and how they are built from smaller units (**morphemes**).
- Brand names often combine morphemes to hint at:
  - Product type or category.
  - Ingredients or materials.
  - Function or benefit.
  - Geographic origin.
  - Company identity or values.

---

### Blends

**Definition**

- A **blend** takes pieces of two (or more) words and fuses them into a new word.
- The parts can:
  - Overlap.
  - Be truncated.
  - Retain full segments from each source word.

**Examples**

- *Vitabath* (vita + bath).
- *Coppertone* (copper + tone).
- *Telstra* (telecom + Australia).
- Many commercial examples show **overlap blends**:
  - e.g. *Aliencounter, Palmolive, Nectarose, Organicurl, Youthair*, etc.

**Reasons blends are popular**

- On packaging, people can often visually parse the two parts.
- Blends are **playful**, **memorable**, and often sound “new”.
- Trademark pressure:
  - Simple real-word names are often taken.
  - Blends create **legally protectable** new lexemes.

---

### Compounds

**Definition**

- A **compound** is made from two (or more) full words.

**Forms**

- Two separate words:
  - *Pizza Hut, Capital One*.
- Single-word compounds:
  - *UnitedHealthcare, PayPal, Facebook, Allstate, AutoZone*.
- Hyphenated compounds:
  - *Coca-Cola, Baskin-Robbins, Mercedes-Benz*.

**Why use compounds?**

- Use familiar words to convey:
  - Product category (*Pizza Hut*).
  - Values (*Capital One* suggests money/finance).
- Easy for consumers to understand and remember.

---

### Affixation

**Definition**

- **Affixation**: forming a new word by adding prefixes or suffixes (or less commonly, infixes) to a base.

**Examples**

- Prefixes:
  - *ProAssurance* (pro + assurance).
  - *Teleflora* (tele + flora).
  - *BioNTech* (bio + n + tech).
- Suffixes:
  - *Jell-O, Gatorade, Walmart, Kleenex* (compare *Windex, Pyrex*).

#### “Techy” and online-sounding affixes

- **i-**:
  - Dominated by Apple (*iPhone, iPad, iMac, iCloud*).
- **e-** (“electronic”):
  - *eBay, eHarmony, eTrade, eVite*.
- **-ify**:
  - *Spotify, Shopify, Insurify, Grammarly* (verb-y, “enable/transform” feel).
- **-r** endings:
  - *Flickr, Tumblr, Quikr, GeoGuessr* (casual web/app style, plus unique spelling for trademarks).

These patterns signal **tech**, **online services**, or **modernity**.

---

## Meaning in Brand Names

### Connotation

Brand names often carry **associations** beyond literal meaning.

**Examples of connotative naming**

- **Low cost / good value**
  - *Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Budget* (car rental), *Price Chopper*.
  - *Muji* (無印良品 “No-Brand Quality Goods”), *Econolodge*.
- **Geographic prestige or identity**
  - *Swatch* (Swiss + watch).
  - *Canada Dry*, *AriZona* iced tea, *Philadelphia* cream cheese.
- **Ingredients / materials**
  - *Milka* (milk chocolate), *Wheaties* (wheat cereal).
  - *Cinnabon* (cinnamon buns), *Pine-Sol* (pine oil cleaner).
- **Speed / efficiency**
  - *Zipcar, Dropbox, EZ-Pass, DoorDash*.

Connotations help position brands in terms of **price, quality, lifestyle, and values**.

---

### Metaphor

**Definition**

- **Metaphor**: using one domain to understand another (“X is Y”), transferring attributes across domains.

**Brand itself is metaphorical**

- Original sense of *brand*: a physical mark burned into livestock or objects.
- Modern sense: an **identity** or **line of products**.

**Metaphoric brand examples**

- Tech:
  - *Oracle* (wisdom, prophecy).
  - *Amazon* (vastness, power, scale).
  - *Nest* (comfort, safety, home).
- Clothing:
  - *Nike* (Greek goddess of victory).
  - *Gap* (identity/generational gap, youth culture).
- Automobiles:
  - *Jaguar, Dodge Ram, Mustang* → speed, strength, agility.
  - VW *Passat* (“trade wind”).
  - Subaru (Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster).
  - Hyundai (“modernity” in Korean).

Metaphor lets brands **borrow cultural imagery** without directly describing the product.

---

### Metonymy and genericization

**Definition**

- **Metonymy**: using a related concept to stand for something else (e.g. “The White House” for the US presidency).

**Brand → generic product**

- Certain brand names become generic terms for the whole product category:
  - *Kleenex* (tissue).
  - *Google* (web search).
  - *Band-Aid* (adhesive bandage).
  - *Photoshop* (image editing).
  - *Thermos, Velcro*, etc.
- Other local examples:
  - *Sunmica* (India, laminate countertop).
  - *Dettol* (UK, disinfectant).
  - *Vetsin* (Philippines, MSG).
  - *Jandals* (NZ, flip-flops).

**Tension**

- Great for **cultural dominance**.
- Bad for **trademark law** if the name becomes too generic.

---

## Language Change, Ethics, and Brand Renaming

### Changing norms and offensive names

Social awareness of racism, sexism, and other discrimination has pushed many organizations to:

- **Retire** or **rebrand** names that rely on caricatures or slurs.
- Update **logos** and **mascots** that encode stereotypes.

---

### Sports team rebranding

- Historical example:
  - Houston Astros were once the **Colt .45s** (gun imagery).
- Native American names and imagery:
  - Cleveland’s baseball team changed from a slur-based name to the **Guardians**.
  - Washington’s NFL team changed from a slur-based name to the **Commanders**.
- Some teams still keep Native American references, generating ongoing debate.

These cases show how **politics, activism, and public opinion** directly affect naming.

---

### Food brands with racist imagery

Several well-known US food brands rebranded in the early 2020s:

- **Aunt Jemima** → **Pearl Milling Company** (pancake syrup).
- **Uncle Ben’s** → **Ben’s Original** (rice).
- **Eskimo Pie** → **Edy’s Pie** (ice cream).

In each case:

- Names, logos, and mascots were tied to **racial caricatures** or outdated stereotypes.
- Companies responded to moral and market pressure.

---

### Case study: Darlie toothpaste

**History**

- 1930s Shanghai: originally sold as **Darkie** toothpaste with a caricatured Black mascot.
- 1980s: acquired by Colgate-Palmolive.
  - English name changed to **Darlie**.
  - Logo softened but still clearly referenced a Black man.
- Chinese name remained **黑人牙膏** (“Black Person Toothpaste”) for decades.
- Only recently rebranded in Chinese to **好來** (Haolai, “good things come”) to align with Darlie and remove explicit racial reference.

**Lesson**

- Rebranding can be **slow and partial**, especially for multilingual brands.
- Enough public pressure and changing norms can force deeper changes later.

---

### Cross-linguistic taboos and local renaming

Names that are harmless in one language can be offensive in another, forcing **market-specific name changes**:

- **Mitsubishi Pajero**:
  - Renamed **Montero** in many Spanish-speaking countries and the US because *pajero* is vulgar slang in some Spanish dialects.
- **Hyundai Kona**:
  - Renamed **Kauai** in Portugal because *kona* resembles a slang term for female genitalia.
- **Renault Arkana**:
  - Sold as **Mégane Conquest** in some ex-Yugoslav markets because *Arkan* evokes a notorious war criminal.

**Takeaway**

- Brand names must be tested against **local slang, history, and culture**, not just in the original language.

---

## Drug Naming Constraints

### Regulatory constraints (FDA and others)

Drug brand names must satisfy several conditions:

1. **Avoid confusion with existing drugs**
   - Names cannot be too similar in spelling or sound to existing drug names to reduce prescription and dispensing errors.
   - Despite this, there are still close calls (e.g. *Cerebyx, Celexa, Celebrex*).

2. **Avoid misleading implications**
   - Names must not:
     - Overstate effectiveness or scope (“cures all”, “rapid” if not uniquely fast).
     - Suggest lower risk than reality.
     - Imply superiority over all competitors.
   - Examples:
     - *Regaine* hair-regrowth drug marketed as **Rogaine** in the US.
     - Insulin marketed as **NovoLog** in the US instead of *NovoRapid*, to avoid overclaiming speed.

---

### Why all the X, Z, Q, and Y?

- Drug names often contain letters like **X, Z, Q, Y** because:
  - They look and sound **high-tech** and “scientific”.
  - They help create **unique, trademarkable** strings.
- Letters like **H, J, W** are often avoided because:
  - They are harder to pronounce across many languages.
  - Pharmaceutical companies want names that can be used globally.

---

### Gendered and affective associations

- Some letters are perceived as more **“feminine”** in certain branding contexts:
  - Letters like **S, M, L** appear frequently in birth-control brands:
    - *Lutera, Lessina, Yasmin, Lybrel, Levora, Jolessa, Alesse*, etc.
- Drug names often hint at desired emotional states or outcomes:
  - **Lunesta** (sleep aid) → evokes “luna” (moon, night).
  - **Ambien** (sleep aid) → often interpreted as suggesting waking up feeling good in the morning.
  - **Allegra** (allergy medication) → echoes “cheerful, lively, joyful”.

These associations are subtle but help make scientific names feel **approachable** and **positive**.

---

## Big Picture Summary

1. **Phonology**
   - Vowel quality, consonant type, and pronounceability influence perceptions of:
     - Size, weight, speed, sharpness, temperature.
     - Risk and danger (especially for hard-to-pronounce names).
   - Unconventional spellings (e.g. vowelless names) change personality impressions (competent vs. rugged).

2. **Morphology**
   - Blends, compounds, and affixes let brands pack multiple meanings into short names.
   - “Techy” affixes and endings (-ify, -r, i-, e-) signal modern, online, or app-based products.

3. **Meaning**
   - Connotation, metaphor, and metonymy connect brands to:
     - Value, geography, myth, and lifestyle.
   - Some brands even become **generic names** for entire product categories.

4. **Language change & ethics**
   - Social and political shifts make some names unacceptable.
   - Rebranding reflects changing norms about racism, sexism, and taboos.
   - Cross-linguistic variation forces local adaptations.

5. **Regulation (especially for drugs)**
   - Drug names face strong constraints from safety and advertising law.
   - This produces the distinctive “science-y” naming style with lots of non-obvious letter combinations.
