# Toponyms & Settlement History

**Key idea**  
Place names (**toponyms**) encode the linguistic and settlement history of a region. By analyzing their structure and spatial distribution, we can infer **who** settled there and **when**.

**Definitions**
- **Toponym**: A place name (city, river, hill, region, etc.).
- **Specifier**: The part that distinguishes this place from other places of the same type (e.g. *Copen-* in **Copenhagen**).
- **Generic**: The general place-type (e.g. *-hagen* “harbor”, *-ton* “town”, *-ham* “home/village”).

**Themes**
- European place names tend to be **descriptive**: physical environment or people living there.
- The **language** of the generic/specifier (and how they cluster geographically) reveals earlier settlement layers.
- Similar specifier+generic patterns show up **across languages** and **within countries**.

# Specifier + Generic Patterns

**Structure**
- Many toponyms are of the form **[specifier + generic]**:
  - e.g. *Oxford* = *ox* (cattle) + *ford* (river crossing).
  - *Newcastle*, *Greenwich*, *Brighton*, etc.
- The **generic** often comes from an older stratum of the language (Old English, Norse, Celtic).

**Cross-linguistic parallels**
- Different languages use **parallel generics**:
  - English *-town*, German *-stadt*, Scandinavian *-by* (settlement), etc.
  - River-related elements, hill/mountain terms, woodland terms, etc.
- Some specifier+generic combinations are so common that they recur across cultures with similar meanings.

**What to practice**
- Identify **specifier** and **generic** in given English place names.
- Guess what the generic means (river, hill, settlement, etc.) and what language it likely comes from.

# Layers of Settlement in Place Names (UK Example)

**Idea**  
In England, toponyms preserve **multiple settlement layers**:
- Pre-Germanic (Celtic) elements.
- Old English elements.
- Norse/Viking elements.
- Norman French additions.

**Mechanism**
- Earlier names are often **not fully replaced**: older generics or specifiers may survive, sometimes only partially recognizable.
- Clusters of certain generics (e.g. Norse-style endings) correlate with regions heavily settled by that group.

**What this shows**
- Even when **languages shift**, **place-name elements** remain as “fossils”.
- We can reconstruct **historical settlement maps** from modern toponyms.

# Multilingual Toponyms within a Single Country

**Pattern**
- Within one country, different regions may show different **place-name languages**:
  - Example: coexisting Celtic, English, and Norse elements in Britain.
- When certain generics cluster in one area, they point to the **prior inhabitants’ language**.

**Inference**
- Spatial clustering of one language’s generics -> region was once dominated by that language group.
- Sudden changes/boundaries in place-name language can match **historical political or settlement boundaries**.

# NYC & US Examples

**NYC area**
- Many NYC-area names are from **Native American** languages:
  - e.g. *Hackensack*, *Passaic*, *Manhattan*.
- Others reflect **Dutch rule** (1624–1664):
  - e.g. *Brooklyn* (from Breukelen), *Harlem* (from Haarlem).
- Others reflect **British rule** (1664–1783) and later **American** myth-making.

**US expansion westward**
- European settlers moved west in **waves**, leaving traces in:
  - Place names (European cities replicated: *New London*, *New Berlin*).
  - County names, townships, and landmarks commemorating heroes, battles, presidents, etc.
- Named maps can show **paths of settlement**, ethnic enclaves, and changing political priorities.

 
# Surnames as Parallel Evidence (pointer)

If you want a general framing of how surnames can function as historical evidence (and how they complement toponyms), see [Names Around the World](https://robinc.vercel.app/note.html?course=LING-UA-2&note=07-world).

# Takeaways

- Place names are **linguistic fossils**: they preserve traces of past languages, peoples, and power.
- The combination of **specifier + generic**, their **languages**, and their **geographic clustering** gives evidence for:
  - Who settled where.
  - In what sequence.
  - How later settlers layered new names on top of older ones.
