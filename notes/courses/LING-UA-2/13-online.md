# Online Names (Usernames, Handles, Email Addresses)

## Overview

Today’s focus: **proper names used online**, especially cases where the name is chosen (or at least editable) and where “being said aloud” is optional.

**Domains**
- **Social media names / handles** (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **Email addresses** (especially in professional contexts)
- **Screen names on dating apps**

**Key question**
- If usernames often never need to be pronounced, do classic “name effects” (like pronounceability) still matter?

---

## Pronounceability as a general name cue

Across many settings, **easy-to-pronounce names** tend to be evaluated more positively.

- Prior result we’ve seen before:
  - **Song & Schwartz (2009)**: easier-to-pronounce **brand names** are rated as **less risky** (hard-to-pronounce names can feel “riskier” in some contexts).

This motivates asking whether pronounceability also matters for:
- **Surnames**
- **Usernames**
- **Email addresses**
- **Dating handles**

## Pronounceability and surnames: Laham et al. (2015)

### Study 1 (ratings: pronounceability, unusualness, liking)
- Participants (Australia) rated:
  1. **How easy the surname is to pronounce**
  2. **How unusual it seems**
  3. **How much they like it**
- Result: both **pronounceability** and **(non-)unusualness** positively correlate with **liking**.

### Study 2 (minimal-information “voting” task)
- Participants were told people can make voting decisions based on little information.
- Given a set of surnames varying in difficulty, participants ranked who they’d vote for.
- Result: **more pronounceable** surnames were ranked **higher**.

### Study 4 (in-group vs out-group labels)
- Australian participants were assigned to conditions where names were framed as:
  - “Australian surnames” vs “American surnames”
- Result: pronounceability predicted likeability **in both conditions**, no meaningful difference by “national group” framing.

### Study 5 (occupational prestige inference)
- American participants judged whether lawyers with certain names held **superior positions**.
- Names varied by:
  - Pronounceability
  - Whether they seemed “Anglo-American” vs “foreign”
- Result: pronounceability correlated with inferred **prestige**, with **no difference** depending on “foreignness”.

**Takeaway**
- Pronounceability is a robust cue for **liking** and **status** judgments, even when people are told very little else.

## Pronounceability in usernames: Neves (2022)

**Question**
- Does pronounceability matter for **usernames**, and does it differ across a social platform vs a professional one?

**Design**
- Portuguese participants rated usernames on 7-point scales of:
  - **Trustworthiness**
  - **Competence**
- Platforms:
  - Instagram (more social)
  - LinkedIn (more professional)

**Results**
- **More pronounceable usernames** were rated as:
  - **More trustworthy**
  - **More competent**
- Stronger effect on **trustworthiness** than competence (bigger boost).
- Main effect of app: Instagram usernames got more positive ratings overall.
- **No interaction**: pronounceability mattered similarly on both Instagram and LinkedIn.

**Takeaway**
- Even if usernames are “not meant to be spoken,” pronounceability still shapes impressions (including in professional contexts).

## Email addresses and hireability: Blackhurst et al. (2011)

**Motivation**
- We know personal names can affect employment outcomes.
- What about **email addresses**, another highly visible “name-like” string?

### Dataset and coding
- Corpus: **14,718** email addresses from job applicants to a US manufacturing distribution center.
- 25 grad students in Industrial-Organizational Psychology rated each email address as:
  - **Appropriate**
  - **Questionable**
  - **Inappropriate**
- Addresses were also coded for specific “unprofessional/antisocial” categories (subthemes).

### Linked measures
Applicants had also taken a standardized test battery measuring:
- **Cognitive ability**
- **Conscientiousness**
- **Professionalism**
- **Work-related experience**
- **Overall score** (combination of the above)

### Findings (big picture)
- Applicants using **inappropriate** email addresses had a **small but statistically significant** decrease in:
  - conscientiousness
  - professionalism
  - work-related experience
- Effects were especially present for subthemes like:
  - youth reference
  - sexual
  - love/inspirational
  - cutesy
  - geeky/nerdy
  - “odd”
- Not notably present for some other categories (for example, “bad/mean,” pop culture, hobby, relationship-to-other).

**Interpretation caution**
- Because the effect is small, the authors caution that email addresses should be treated as a **yellow flag** (a weak signal), not a sole reason for rejection.

**Takeaway**
- Email addresses can function as a thin slice of social information: not determinative, but not neutral either.

## Dating handles: Whitty & Buchanan (2011)

**Question**
- Which kinds of screen names are judged most attractive, and which make people most willing to initiate contact?

### Screen-name categories (5 types)
Usernames (from a dating site) were categorized into:
1. **Physical** (Blondie, Blueeyes, Goodlooking, Greatbody, Kissme)
2. **Neutral** (Smith48, 0257, Justme, Me)
3. **Wealthy** (Silverspoon, Millionaire, Sunnyporche)
4. **Intellectual** (Welleducated, Wellread, Cultured, Artist)
5. **Miscellaneous** (humor, personality traits, etc., Enigma, Nosugaradded, Bubbly)

### Participants and tasks
- Participants: 404 users (ultimately focused on US/UK subset).
- Two ratings (1–5):
  1. “How attractive do you find the following names?”
  2. “Based purely on the screen name, how motivated would you be to contact someone with this name?”

### Overall ordering (attractiveness and motivation)
- **Physical** highest
- Then **Intellectual**
- Then **Wealthy**
- Then **Miscellaneous**
- **Neutral** lowest

### Gender differences (reported patterns)
- Men rated **Physical** names as more attractive and were more motivated to contact those than women were.
- Women rated **Neutral** and **Intellectual** names as more attractive (and were more motivated) relative to men.

### Notes and interpretation
- People were often motivated to contact the names they rated most attractive (counter to an idea that fear of rejection might suppress contacting “high-attractiveness” profiles).
- A key limitation: results might differ if photos were included (screen name alone is not the whole profile).

**Takeaway**
- On dating apps, screen names that explicitly signal traits (physical or intellectual) tend to be judged more attractive than neutral strings, while wealth references are not universally appealing.

## Summary: what these studies suggest

1. **Pronounceability remains influential** even when the name-like string is “just text” (usernames, handles).
2. **Context matters**, but not always via interaction effects (for example, pronounceability helps on both Instagram and LinkedIn).
3. **Email addresses behave like a professionalism signal**: usually weak, but correlated with other measures and potentially relevant as a warning sign.
4. **Dating handles are interpreted as self-advertisement**, and different “signals” (physical, intellectual, wealth) invite different reactions.

---

## Practical discussion questions (for class or review)

- If usernames aren’t spoken aloud, why might pronounceability still matter? (Think: fluency, ease of processing, “feels familiar”.)
- Should employers treat email addresses as evidence of personality, or mostly as an artifact of age/culture? Where’s the fairness line?
- How do these results connect to earlier themes about names as social signals (bias, identity, strategy)?
