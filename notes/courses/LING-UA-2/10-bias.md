# Implicit Bias & Names

**Definition**
- **Implicit bias**: behavior shaped by **unconscious** or **unintended** attitudes and stereotypes (Moss-Racusin et al. 2012).
- Names make social categories (gender, race, ethnicity) **immediately visible** and thus become a site where implicit bias shows up.

**Key idea**
- By holding everything else constant (CV, resume, email) and only changing the **name**, we can detect how bias influences:
  - Evaluations,
  - Hiring decisions,
  - Political support,
  - Responsiveness to requests.

# Gender Bias in Academic Evaluations

## Steinpreis, Anders & Ritzke (1999)

**Design**
- Sent identical academic CVs (e.g. Assistant Professor position) with only the **name** changed:
  - e.g. *Karen Miller* vs *Brian Miller*.
- Evaluated by **US-based academic psychologists**.

**Findings**
- The CV with a **male** name was:
  - More likely to be **recommended for hire**.
  - Rated higher on **competence** and **hirability**, despite identical records.
- Shows **gender bias** even among trained scientists.

## Carlsson et al. (2021)

**Design**
- Similar CV experiment in **Iceland, Sweden, and the US**.
- Tested whether the direction/strength of gender bias generalized across countries.

**Findings**
- Some contexts showed **bias in the opposite direction** (e.g. women favored).
- Interpretation:
  - Gender bias is **context-dependent**.
  - Different societies and disciplines can embed **different stereotypes** and policies (e.g. explicit gender equity initiatives) that shape results.

# Name Femaleness & Vote Share (Urbatsch 2018)

**Question**
- Does having a more **“feminine”** name affect a political candidate’s **vote share**?

**Data**
- US **state legislature elections** (2003–2010).

**Measuring name femaleness**
- Use databases (e.g. Social Security) to estimate, for each first name:
  - Proportion of bearers who are **female** vs **male**.
- A name’s **“femaleness”** = roughly how strongly it is associated with women.

**Method**
- Ordinary Least Squares (**OLS**) regression:
  - Dependent variable: candidate’s **vote share**.
  - Predictors include:
    - Name femaleness score,
    - Candidate gender,
    - Party, incumbency, etc.

**Issues to think about**
- Limitations of the metric:
  - Sensitive to **time** (names can shift gender association).
  - Not all groups are equally represented in the data.
  - May blur cultural/ethnic differences.

**Findings (big picture)**
- Results suggest that name-based gender impressions can affect **electoral outcomes**, but:
  - Effects may differ for **male vs female** candidates,
  - And may interact with **party** and **district** characteristics.

# Racial & Ethnic Bias: Resumé and Request Studies

## Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)

**Design**
- Sent pairs of **identical resumes** to real job ads in Chicago/Boston newspapers.
- Only manipulated the **name**:
  - Names perceived as **“White-sounding”** vs **“Black-sounding”**.

**Results**
- “White” names got **significantly more callbacks** than “Black” names.
- The gap remained even when qualifications on the “Black” resumes were improved.
- Interpretation:
  - Employers used names as a **signal** of race and discriminated accordingly.

## Oreopoulos (2011): immigrant names and callbacks (Canada)

**Design (field experiment)**
- Researchers sent **identical resumes** to real job postings, varying only the **name type** and some credential combinations.
- Name types included:
  - Prototypically **Anglo/“Canadian”** names,
  - Chinese/Indian/Pakistani names paired with **Canadian education & experience**,
  - Other combinations (for example, **foreign education**), and mixed names (Anglo first + non-Anglo last).
- Outcome: **callback rate** for interviews.

**Key patterns (as summarized in class)**
- Resumes with **Anglo names + Canadian credentials** received the **highest callback rates**.
- Holding credentials constant, adding a clearly **non-Anglo name** reduced callbacks.
- An Anglo first name combined with a non-Anglo last name did **not fully remove** the penalty.

**Interpretation**
- Employers may use names as signals of **ethnicity/foreignness**, and discrimination can persist even when qualifications are “local”.

## Names from African and other non-majority languages

- Names from languages such as **Yoruba**, **Arabic**, and others may:
  - Be misread as **foreign**, **Muslim**, or **Black**.
  - Trigger stereotypes related to **race**, **religion**, or **migration**.
- Similar resume/email experiments show lower responsiveness to these names, even with **identical content**.

# Faculty Email & Response Studies (Milkman et al. 2012, etc.)

**Design**
- Sent standardized email requests (e.g. asking to meet) to faculty, changing only:
  - The **name** of the supposed student (signaling race/gender).
- Compared **response rates** and **warmth** of responses.

**Findings**
- Faculty were more responsive to names perceived as **White male**, compared to:
  - White female,
  - Black, Latinx, or Asian male/female names.
- Disaggregating by **ethnicity x gender** showed that **nearly all non-White/non-male combinations** got fewer positive responses.

**Takeaway**
- Bias is often **intersectional**: race + gender interact.
- Discrimination is visible in everyday, low-stakes interactions (just answering an email).

---

# Names, Accent & Perceived Professionalism

**Accent-based bias**
- Names can prime expectations about **accent**.
- Studies of **phone calls** or **recorded speech** show that:
  - Speakers with “foreign” accents are often judged as **less competent** or **less trustworthy**,
  - Even when objective content is identical.

**Connection to names**
- A name may:
  - Raise expectations of a certain accent,
  - Serve as a reason to treat someone as “other” or “less qualified”.

---

# Where Do We Go From Here?

**Key insights**
- Names do not merely label individuals; they **trigger stereotypes** about:
  - Gender,
  - Race/ethnicity,
  - Nationality, religion, class.
- These stereotypes can measurably affect:
  - Hiring,
  - Academic evaluation,
  - Political support,
  - Everyday responses to requests.

**Open questions / directions**
- How can institutions **mitigate** name-based discrimination?
  - Blind review of resumes,
  - Training for implicit bias,
  - Monitoring response patterns and outcomes.
- How do people **strategically choose** or **modify** names to navigate these biases?

---

# Summary

- Experimental designs that hold everything constant except the **name** reveal pervasive **implicit bias**.
- Names are a major channel through which **social inequality** is reproduced, even when people believe they are acting “objectively”.
