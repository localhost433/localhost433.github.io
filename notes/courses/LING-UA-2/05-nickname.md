# Truncation & Affixation (English)

## What nicknames are (and aren’t)
- **Hypocoristics**: familiar/pet forms built from a **base** (the full name).  
- Not all nicknames are predictable (*idiosyncratic* ones exist), but **outside** those, English speakers show **strong, systematic intuitions** about how to build them.

## The Truncation Rule (core generalization)
Starting at the **left edge** of the base, take the **longest possible substring** that:
1. forms a **single syllable**, and  
2. **does not** violate English **phonotactics**.  
This single-syllable output is the **truncatum**.

**Examples & diagnostics**
- David [ˈdeɪ.vɪd] -> *Da [deɪ]* (wrong) -> **Dave [deɪv]** (correct)  
- Emily [ˈɛ.mɪ.li] -> *E [ɛ]* (wrong) -> **Em [ɛm]** (correct)  
- Diana [daɪˈæ.nə] -> *Dia [daɪˈæ]* (wrong) -> **Di [daɪ]** (correct)  
- Walter [ˈwɑl.tɚ] -> *Wal [wɑl]* (wrong) -> **Walt [wɑlt]** (correct)

**Why failures occur**
- The failed candidates either **aren’t a single syllable**, or end up with **illegal clusters/positions** (phonotactic violations).

**Further illustrations**
- Abraham [ˈeɪ.bɹə.hæm] -> *Abr [eɪbɹ]* (wrong) -> **Abe [eɪb]** (correct)  
- Edward [ˈɛ.dwɚd] -> *Edw [ɛdw]* (wrong) -> **Ed [ɛd]** (correct)  
- Daniel [ˈdæn.jəl] -> *Dani [dænj]* (wrong) -> **Dan [dæn]** (correct)

**Notes and common exceptions**
- **Monosyllables** typically don’t truncate alone: *John, George* -> (no truncation-only form).  
- **Non-initial stress** often correlates with non-initial truncata:  
  Eugene [juˈdʒin] -> **Gene**; Augustus [ɔˈɡʌ.stʌs] -> **Gus**; Patricia [pæˈtɹɪ.ʃə] -> **Trish**/**Pat**.  
- **Vowel-initial bases** may yield onset-preserving truncata: Albert -> **Bert**; Andrew -> **Drew**.  
- Some truncata are **two syllables** when the base’s first syllable is unstressed: Rebecca -> **Becca**; Alexander -> **Alex**.  
- Some truncata are **shorter** than maximal: Christopher -> **Chris** (*≠* [kɹɪst]); Susan -> **Sue**.  
- Truncata that would end in **[ɹ]** often shift to avoid ill-formed codas: Sarah -> **Sal** (*≠* *Sar*); Morrissey -> **Moz** (*≠* *Mor*).  
- The generalization: **truncata that violate English phonotactics don’t surface**.

## Affixation (assembly-line style)
- After truncation, English frequently **adds a suffix**, commonly **[i]** spelled *-y/-ie/-i*:  
  Jessica [ˈdʒɛ.sɪ.kə] -> [dʒɛs] -> **Jessie**;  
  Oliver [ˈɑ.lɪ.vɚ] -> [ɑl] -> **Ollie**;  
  Virginia [vɚˈdʒɪn.jə] -> [dʒɪn] -> **Ginnie**.
- Other suffixes show dialectal flavor:  
  Beckham -> **Becks**; Julie -> **Jules**; Laura -> **Lozza** (British).

## The same machinery for non-name words
- sorry -> soz
- vegetable -> veg -> veggie;
- chocolate -> choc -> choccy;
- totally -> tote -> totes;
- journalist -> journ -> journo;
- pregnant -> preg -> preggers;
- ridiculous -> ridic;
- whatever -> whatev -> whatevs;
- amazing -> amaz -> amazeballs.

**Takeaways**
- English nicknaming ≈ **truncate** then **affix**, subject to **phonotactics**, stress, and a few well-attested exceptions.
- The process is **productive**, historically **attested**, and part of speakers’ tacit knowledge.

# Reduplication (focus on French; English comparisons)

## What is reduplication?
- **Linguistic doubling**: repeat a **word** (full reduplication) or **part** (partial reduplication).  
- In English hypocoristics it’s occasional: *Taylor -> Tay-Tay*; *John -> John-John*. Across languages, reduplication often marks **plurality**, **intensification**, or **semantic nuance**.

## French hypocoristics: rules/pressures
French uses **truncation** and, in many cases, **reduplication**, governed by robust (often violable) constraints:

1. **Disyllabic pressure**: nicknames should be **two syllables**.  
   - Three-syllable bases satisfied by truncating **from the left**:  
     Dorothée [do.ʀo.te] -> **Doro [do.ʀo]**; Caroline [ka.ʀo.lin] -> **Caro [ka.ʀo]**; Dominique [do.mi.nik] -> **Domi [do.mi]**.  
   - Or by truncating **from the right**:  
     Ernestine [eʀ.nɛs.tin] -> **Nestine**; Élodie [e.lo.di] -> **Lodie**; Élisabeth [e.li.za.bɛt] -> **Zabeth**.

2. **Consonant-initial**: nicknames prefer to start with a **consonant**.  
3. **Non-identity**: the nickname should **not be identical** to the base.  
4. **Open syllables in reduplication**: the doubled syllable should be **open** (avoid coda consonants).  
   - If needed, reduplicate a **portion** to keep it open:  
     Lise [liz] -> [li] -> **Lili**; Emile [e.mil] -> [mil] -> **Mimile**; Hélène [e.lɛn] -> [lɛn] -> **Lélène**.  
5. **Avoid clusters**: simplify or choose material that **avoids consonant clusters**.  
   - Brigitte [bʀi.ʒit] -> [bi] -> **Bibi**; Claude [klod] -> [ko] -> **Coco**.  
6. **Right-edge starts / reversal** where needed:  
   - Otto [o.to] -> [to] -> **Toto** (*≠* *o.o*); Annie [a.ni] -> [ni] -> **Nini** (*≠* *a.a*).  
   - One-syllable bases may **reverse** then reduplicate to satisfy onset/open-syllable pressures:  
     An [an] -> [na] -> **Nana**; Yves [iv] -> [vi] -> **Vivi**; Hugues [yɡ] -> [ɡy] -> **Gugu**.

## Probabilistic tendencies (French)
- **Sound symbolism** sometimes exploited (e.g., “lighter” sequences like [ni] in **Nini**).  
- **Avoid typologically unusual sounds**: replace/remove segments dispreferred cross-linguistically or in child acquisition.  
- Many pressures mirror **child phonology** (preference for open syllables, fewer clusters).

## English–French parallels
- Both exhibit **assembly-line** processing, but English leans on **[i]-affixation** after a **single-syllable truncatum**, while French frequently **reduplicates** to meet **disyllabicity** and **open-syllable** preferences.

**Takeaways (Oct 9)**
- French hypocoristics = truncation **+** constraint-satisfying **reduplication**; strategy choice (left/right edge, reversal, simplification) follows general phonological pressures.
- Reduplication as a nickname device in Indo-European is **concentrated in hypocoristics**, even if reduplication is widespread typologically.

## Practice
- Apply the **Truncation Rule** and **[i]-affixation** to **Rudolph** and **Douglas**; justify phonotactics.  
- For French data, derive **Dédé**, **Coco**, **Bibi**, **Nana** from the bases, stating which rules each step satisfies.  
- Diagnose why *Sab* (from *Isabella*) or *Dward* (from *Edward*) fail; propose the well-formed outputs.
