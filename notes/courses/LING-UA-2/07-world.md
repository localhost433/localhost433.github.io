# Names Around the World

## Overview

- Two main questions:
  1. **Surnames** – How are they formed and assigned in different societies?
  2. **Given names** – Does the **state** ever regulate what you can be called?

- Broad surname types:
  - **Patronymic/matronymic**: formed from a parent’s given name.
  - **Hereditary surnames**: fixed across generations, not identical to the parent’s given name.
  - **Tribal / clan affiliations**: encode membership in a **lineage** or **clan**.

## Patronymic & Matronymic systems

### Iceland

- Canonical modern patronymic system:
  - Child’s “surname” = **parent’s given name + suffix**.
  - **Son**: *-son* (‘son of’), e.g. **Einar Jónsson** (“Einar, Jón’s son”).
  - **Daughter**: *-dóttir* (‘daughter of’), e.g. **Eva Jónsdóttir**.
- 2019 Gender Autonomy Act:
  - Introduces **-bur** ‘child’ as a **gender-neutral** option when a parent is registered non-binary.
- Some Icelandic last names come from other sources, but **most** follow the patronymic pattern.

### Ethiopia / Eritrea / Djibouti

- Similar logic but with **three names**:
  - **Given name** (person),
  - **Father’s given name**,
  - **Grandfather’s given name**.
- People are addressed by **given name** with a title:
  - e.g. *ato Mohamed* (‘Mr. Mohamed’), *Professor Tsehay*.
- Emphasis is on **lineage**, but usage in everyday address focuses on the **given name + title**.

### Russia

- **Hereditary surname** + **patronymic middle name**:
  - Patronymic is formed from the father’s given name:
    - Male: **-ovich / -evich**
    - Female: **-ovna / -evna**
  - Example:  
    - *Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov* (father = Roman).  
    - Sister: *Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova*.
- Patronymics are a core part of **formal address**:
  - Workplace, school, official contexts use **first name + patronymic**.
- Formation rules depend on the **final letters** of the father’s name; multiple spelling rules govern the suffix choice.

## Hereditary surnames and their origins

Many hereditary surnames started out as **descriptive phrases**, then fossilized.

### Former patronymics

- Originally indicated **“X’s son/daughter”**, but now just **family names**:
  - Anglo: **Johnson, Robertson, Davidson**.
  - Scandinavian: **Nielsen, Rasmussen, Hansen, Olsen, Andersson, Johansson**.
  - Spanish: **-ez** suffix (from Latin “descendant of”):  
    **Domínguez, López, Martínez, Pérez, Rodríguez, Sánchez**, etc.

### Geographic / toponymic surnames

- Refer to **places** or **landscape features**:

Specific locations:
- Italian: **Di Napoli** (‘from Naples’), **Fiorentino** (‘from Florence’).
- Polish: **Krakowski** (‘from Krakow’).

Geographic features:
- Japanese: **Yamamoto** (‘mountain base’), **Tanaka** (‘rice field’), **Nakamura** (‘central village’), **Kimura** (‘tree village’).
- Finnish: **Nieminen** (‘peninsula’), **Virtanen** (‘small stream’), **Mäkelä** (‘hill / farmstead’).

### Occupational surnames

- Encode **traditional professions**:

  - English: **Smith, Miller, Baker**.
  - German: **Weber** (‘weaver’), **Zimmermann** (‘carpenter’), **Wagner** (‘wagon maker/driver’).
  - Arabic: **Al-Sayyad** (‘hunter/fisher’), **Al-Tabib** (‘doctor’).
  - Turkish: **Demir** (‘ironworker’), **Bardakci** (‘glassblower’), **Terzi** (‘tailor’).
  - French: **Meunier** (‘miller’), **Berger** (‘shepherd’), **Boucher** (‘butcher’).
  - Indian subcontinent: **Acharya** (‘teacher’), **Patel** (‘village head’), **Gandhi** (‘perfumer’).

### Traits and personal characteristics

- Some surnames derive from **qualities** or **physical traits**:

  - Indian subcontinent (often Sanskrit-origin): **Sharma** (‘joy/shelter’), **Gupta** (‘protected/hidden’), **Iyer** (‘learned one’).
  - Persian: **Masoumi** (‘innocence’), **Behnam** (‘honorable’).
  - Polish: **Nowak** (‘newcomer’), **Wesoły** (‘cheerful’).
  - Spanish: **Delgado** (‘thin’), **Rubio** (‘blonde’), **Grande** (‘large’).

## Clan and tribal surnames

### Scottish clans

- Historically, clan surnames encoded **membership and allegiance**:
  - Not only blood relatives; anyone living on the **chief’s land** could adopt the name.
  - Surnames were **patrilineal**.
- Examples:
  - **Campbell, Duncan, Robertson, MacDonald, MacKenzie**.
- Morphology:
  - **Mac/Mc** = ‘son of’ (Gaelic).
  - **-son** and **-s** in English also serve as patronymic markers (e.g. **Robertson, Adams**).

### Korean clans

- Modern Korean surnames often reflect **historical clan affiliation**.
- A clan is defined by:
  - The **surname**, and
  - The **bon-gwan**: ancestral place/region of origin.
- Example:
  - **Kim** is shared across many clans; the **Gimhae Kim** clan traces legendary ancestry to Kim Suro.
- People can share the same **surname** but belong to **different clans**, distinguished by bon-gwan.

## Given names and state regulation

- Some states **regulate given names** to:
  - Ensure they use the **official writing system**,  
  - Protect children from **offensive or impractical names**, or  
  - Preserve **cultural traditions**.
- Mechanisms include:
  - **Approved name lists**,
  - Requiring names to be **spelled in a particular script**,  
  - Allowing or restricting certain **morphological patterns** (e.g. gendered endings).

## Takeaways

- Surname systems encode:
  - **Family structure** (patronymic vs hereditary),
  - **History of professions, places, and traits**,
  - **Tribal or clan affiliation**.
- Given-name systems show how **governments and societies**:
  - Shape personal identity through **law and policy**,
  - Balance **individual choice** with **linguistic and cultural norms**.
