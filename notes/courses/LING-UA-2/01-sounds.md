# Consonants

## How we classify consonants
Consonants are described by **place of articulation** (where in the vocal tract the constriction is), **voicing** (vocal folds vibrating or not), **manner of articulation** (how narrow/complete the constriction is), and **oral vs. nasal** airflow.

### Places of articulation (English examples)
- **Labial**
  - **Bilabial**: [p] *pit*, [b] *bit*, [m] *mitt*
  - **Labiodental**: [f] *fan*, [v] *van*
- **Coronal**
  - **Interdental**: [θ] *breath*, [ð] *breathe*
  - **Alveolar**: [t] *tip*, [d] *dip*, [s] *sip*, [z] *zip*, [n] *nip*, [l] *lip*, [ɹ] *rip*
  - **Alveo-palatal**: [ʃ] *Asher*, [ʒ] *azure*, [tʃ] *chip/search*, [dʒ] *judge*
  - **Palatal**: [j] *yacht*
- **Dorsal**
  - **Velar**: [k] *pick*, [g] *pig*, [ŋ] *ping*
  - **Labiovelar**: [w] *wig*
- **Glottal**: [h] *head*.

### Voicing
Some pairs differ **only** in voicing while oral articulation is the same (e.g., [s] vs. [z]). A quick test is whether you feel vocal-fold “buzz.”

### Manners of articulation
- **Stops**: complete oral closure -> [p b t d k g]
- **Fricatives**: narrow constriction with turbulent airflow -> [f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ h]
- **Affricates**: stop + fricative release -> [tʃ dʒ]  
  The set **stops+fricatives+affricates** are **obstruents**.

- **Nasals**: oral closure, airflow through nose -> [m n ŋ]
- **Approximants**: relatively open oral tract -> [l ɹ w j]  
  **Nasals+approximants** are **sonorants**; in English, sonorants are voiced.

# Vowels

## How we classify vowels
Vowels are described by **height** (tongue high–low), **backness** (front–back), and **lip rounding**. These dimensions are summarized in the **vowel quadrilateral**.
### American English vowel inventory (high-level)
- **Front**: [i] (*heed*), [ɪ] (*hid*), [eɪ] (*hayed*), [ɛ] (*head*), [æ] (*had*)
- **Back**: [u] (*who’d*), [ʊ] (*hood*), [oʊ] (*hoed*), [ɔ] (*hawed*, not in all dialects), [ɑ] (*hod*)
- **Central**: [ʌ] (*cut*), [ə] (*sofa*, unstressed “schwa”)  
Rounded back vowels include [u ʊ oʊ ɔ].

### Diphthongs vs. monophthongs
- **Diphthongs**: vowel quality moves during the syllable -> [eɪ], [oʊ], [aɪ] (*bite*), [aʊ] (*bout*), [ɔɪ] (*boy*)
- **Monophthongs**: relatively stationary tongue configuration.
### Lax vowels and word-final position
The **lax** set [ɪ ɛ æ ʊ] (and [æ], [ɛ]) have distributional constraints in American English-for instance, they generally do **not** appear word-finally without a following consonant.

# Syllables & Stress

## What is a syllable?
A **syllable** minimally contains a vowel; many English syllable shapes combine consonants and vowels (e.g., **CV** *tea*, **CCV** *glue*, **CVC** *pot*, **CCVCC** *stink*). Complex clusters occur in words like *sixths* [sɪksθs], *twelfths* [twɛlfθs].

### Parts of a syllable
- **Nucleus** (vowel)
- **Onset** (consonants before nucleus)
- **Coda** (consonants after nucleus).

### Syllable-building heuristics (English)
1. **Nucleus Rule:** create a syllable for every vowel/diphthong.
2. **Onset Rule:** maximize onset consonants-but only sequences that can begin a word may be onsets (*e.g.*, [ŋ], /ktr/ cannot start English words).
3. **Coda Rule:** leftover consonants fill the coda.  
Try parsing **conflict** and **manuscript** using these rules.

## Phonotactics (what sequences are allowed)
- English allows clusters but not all combinations: *[ktɑm]* is ill-formed in English (though cf. Polish [kto] *‘who’*); *strict* [stɹɪkt] is fine, but *[stlɪtk]* is not.
- **Nasal place assimilation** before oral stops: *romp* [ɹɑmp], *lent* [lɛnt], *skunk* [skʌŋk].
- Some segments occur only in onsets or only in codas: [tʌŋ] ‘tongue’ vs. *[ŋʌt]*; [hɪm] ‘him’ vs. *[mɪh]*.
- Some vowels require codas; **lax** vowels [ɪ ɛ æ ʊ] cannot appear word-finally without a following consonant (e.g., [pɛg] but not *[pɛ]).

## Lexical stress
English contrasts stress positions: **OBject** (noun) vs. **obJECT** (verb); **CONflict** (n) vs. **conFLICT** (v). Prominence typically involves higher pitch, longer duration, and greater intensity on the stressed vowel.

### Common stress patterns
- **Two syllables:** **Trochee** (first-syllable stress) *never, window, sprinkle*; **Iamb** (second-syllable stress) *indeed, perhaps, amuse*.
- **Three syllables:** **Final** (*introduce, guarantee, comprehend*), **Penultimate** (*bandana, December, regardless*), **Antepenultimate** (*excellent, festival, happily*).
> **Names & stress:** Try naming examples that fit each pattern; note why some shortened forms are impossible (*Jennifer -> Jen*, but not *Je*; *Alfred -> Al/Alf*, but not *Alfr*).
