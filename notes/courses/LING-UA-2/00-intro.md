## The scientific study of language (LING-UA 2)

### Linguistics: What do linguists want to know?
- What is language?
- How is language physically embodied and cognitively processed?
- How is language use socially embedded?

*(from U. of Michigan Dept. of Linguistics)*

### In this class, we’ll try to find out…
- **What is language?** Are names part of language, or are they separate? Do they show the same sorts of patterns as non-name elements of language? How do names and naming processes differ (or not) around the world?
- **How is language physically embodied and cognitively processed?** How do our brains produce and perceive names? Is it different from how they produce and perceive non-name elements of language?
- **How is language use socially embedded?** How do names reflect the social characteristics of their bearers? Can one’s name influence their life outcomes?

## Names and society
- First names, just like other aspects of language, have social correlates. Names and language can be signals about who we are and where we come from. *(Namegrapher)*
- But names can also be a double-edged sword. When society discriminates against people from certain backgrounds, if one’s background is evident through their name, names can be a target of discrimination.
