## How does language work?
- Language as a mapping
    ```
    form                 <->               function
    sound/sign <-> words <-> sentences <-> meaning
    ```
- what exactly do we know when we say we 'know' a language?

## What does it mean to 'know' a language
### Linguistic competence
Sounds, words, linguistic structures, meanings, etc.
Mostly unconscious

#### Knowledge of sound patterns: Phonetics
- Inventory of sounds
  - Which sounds exists in the language
  - How does sounds distinct from each other
- which sounds can occur where

#### Knowledge of Word patterns: Morphology
[Morpheme:= smallest meaningful unit.](##Morphology)

#### Knowledge of sentence patterns: Syntax

#### Knowledge of meaning patterns: Semantics
Logical implication for the sentence.

### Communicative competence
- Knowledge of how and when to use those linguistic structures

The way people use languages.

## Key features of language
1. Arbitrariness
   No inherent connection between the word and the thing, just **convention**.
2. Displacement
   Use language to communicate about things that are unrelated to (or distant from) the here and now.
3. Discreteness
   Made up of discrete units: sounds, words, phrases, etc.
5. Creativity
   Use language to form an infinite set of well-formed, grammatical sentences.
6. Rule-Governedness
   - Follow a set of conventional rules (grammar).
   - Govern how linguistic units are constructed and how they fit together.
   - (Include "non-standard" dialects and slangs as well)

Does not have a distinguish between dialect and language for linguists.
