            <h1>Hello, I'm Robin.</h1>
            <p>
                A little bit of self intro, I'm a <del>freshman</del> sophomore at the NYU studying Mathematics and
                Computer Science. (Planning on getting a minor in linguistics) This site serves as a platform for me
                to document my thoughts, projects, and anything else I find worth sharing. I share random ideas and
                stuff I created about school, life, etc. (Not any type of category that I want to fall into, journal,
                diary, because it would feel kind of restrictive on 'how'/'what' should I write about anything.)
                <br><br>
                If you are viewing this using a text based browser, unfortunately, you won't be able to see most of
                the content here as I heavily rely on JavaScript to render the content dynamically, and I'm too lazy
                to add a static fallback. (I found out this problem when I was trying to use Lynx to view my site 
                yesterday. Why did I try to do that? Good question.)
            </p>

            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>
                This site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm trying to use minimal dependencies to
                stay lightweight, the ones being used including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>js-yaml</code> - parse front-matter in notes</li>
                <li><code>DOMPurify</code> - sanitize rendered HTML</li>
                <li><code>MathJax</code> - render LaTeX/math expressions</li>
                <li><code>marked.js</code> - Markdown -> HTML parsing</li>
                <li><code>node-fetch</code> - HTTP client for serverless functions</li>
                <li><code>sanitize-html</code> - clean user input in comments</li>
                <li><code>@upstash/redis</code> - serverless KV caching</li>
                <li><code>pg</code> - Neon serverless PostgreSQL driver</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to add more features and improve the design over time. Email me if you have suggestions!
                Currently, some ideas include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><del>Improving the comment system</del> (Done)</li>
                <li><u>Converting all my course notes into markdown</u> (Done partial, in progress)</li>
                <li><u>Organizing stuff I wrote during the summer into blog posts</u> (In progress)</li>
